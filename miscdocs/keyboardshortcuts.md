Interface 2: Editor keyboard shortcuts

When using the passage editor in Twine 2, the following keyboard (and mouse) shortcuts are available. Note that many of these (in particular, those involving cursor movement and selections) are shared across all Twine story formats, not just Harlowe. In the notation below, substitute Ctrl for âŒ˜ if you are using MacOS.

| Keyboard shortcut | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+Left Click | Create additional text cursors. These cursors all output the same text at their location when you type, and can be moved simultaneously. Use this feature to edit or insert the same text in multiple locations. |
| Ctrl+Left Drag | Create multiple, disconnected text selections without deselecting the current selections. These can all be edited simultaneously by typing, like single selections. |
| Ctrl+D | Delete the entire line that the cursor is on. |
| Ctrl+Home | Move the cursor to the top of the passage. |
| Ctrl+End | Move the cursor to the bottom of the passage. |
| Ctrl+Left | Move the cursor to the start of the previous "clump" of characters. These are either words (clumps of alphanumeric characters), runs of punctuation, or runs of multiple whitespace characters. |
| Ctrl+Right | Move the cursor to the end of the next "clump" of characters. These are either words (clumps of alphanumeric characters), runs of punctuation, or runs of multiple whitespace characters. |
| Alt+Left | Move the cursor to the start of the current line. |
| Alt+Right | Move the cursor to the end of the current line. |
| Ctrl+B | Wrap the current selected text in the "bold" style markup. |
| Ctrl+I | Wrap the current selected text in the "italic" style markup. |
| Ctrl+- | Wrap the current selected text in the "strikethrough" style markup. |
| Ctrl+. | Wrap the current selected text in the "superscript" style markup. |
| Ctrl+F | Open the Find/Replace panel. |
| Ctrl+G | Go to the next Find/Replace match (scroll it onto the screen, and make it the target of the next "Replace" operation). |
| Ctrl+Shift+G | Go to the previous Find/Replace match. |
| Ctrl+H | Replace the current Find/Replace match. |

In addition to these, the most basic text editor operations (like using Ctrl-Z to undo, Ctrl-Y or Ctrl-Shift-Z to redo, Ctrl+A to select all of the text, Shift+Left or Shift+Right to adjust the current selection, dragging the current selected text to reposition it, and the like) are, of course, also available.
