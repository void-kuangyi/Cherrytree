Introduction 1: Report bugs and suggest features

If you think you've found a bug to report in Harlowe, want to make a feature suggestion, or wish to see what future features are already planned, simply visit [the project's issues page](https://foss.heptapod.net/games/harlowe/-/issues).

I'd appreciate it if you could adhere to the following guidelines when reporting bugs or proposals:

 * Please try to check that the bug has not been reported before, using the issue search feature.
 * Please do not report more than one bug per issue - make as many issues as you need.
 * Please be as detailed as possible in the issue title.
 * But, at the same time, avoid overly general anecdotes or descriptions of your work process leading to the bug (like "I'm trying to write an inventory system") - try to focus on what you expected the code to do, and what you got instead.
 * You *should* report all cases where a new version of Harlowe caused your formerly-working story to suddenly not work, as long as a possible reason was not mentioned anywhere in the [changelog](#section_changes).
 * Do include code samples, but please write them inside code blocks (using the Code `</>` button in the toolbar).
 * Don't change the "Assignee", "Milestone" or "Due Date".
 * If your issue is a bug, please set the "Label" to "Bug".
 * You *may* suggest feature requests, but please set the issue's "Label" to "Proposal".

### File reports for this documentation, too!

Harlowe is maintained by one person (me) out of a single interactive fiction language development bedroom. As such, I only have a limited number of staff to keep watch over the documentation and the program. I appreciate all reports about documentation slip-ups, typos, outdated advice, flat-out incorrect examples, and so forth.

### A brief note of thanks

Big thanks to [Octobus SAS](https://octobus.net/) for providing this free open-source software hosting service, and [Clever Cloud SAS](https://www.clever-cloud.com/) for that service's hosting.
