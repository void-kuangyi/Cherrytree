			An optional changer can be given to alter the style of the link
			(instead of altering the style of the attached hook).
			
			Example usage:
			* `(link: "Stake")[The dracula crumbles to dust.]` will create a link reading "Stake"
			which, when clicked, disappears and shows "The dracula crumbles to dust."
			* `(link: "Click to continue")[==` will create a link that, using the unclosed hook syntax,
			defers the display of the remainder of the passage until it is clicked.
			
			Rationale:
			
			As you're aware, links are what the player uses to traverse your story. However,
			links can also be used to simply display text or run macros inside hooks. Just
			attach the (link:) macro to a hook, and the entire hook will not run or appear at all until the
			player clicks the link.
			
			Note that this particular macro's links disappear when they are clicked - if you want
			their words to remain in the text, or for only a small portion of the text
			to disappear, consider using (link-reveal:).
			
			Details:
			This creates a link which is visually indistinguishable from normal passage links. However, a changer can optionally be given, after the
			string, to change the appearance of the link. This must be a changer that would be accepted by (enchant-in:) or
			(link-style:) - which is to say, (link:), (replace:), (append-with:), or any of their relatives cannot be given, or else an error will result.
			Note that if you wish to apply a changer to every link in the passage (or, via the use of a 'header' or 'footer' tagged passage, every link
			in the story), then you can simply use (enchant:) with ?Link instead.

			The created link is displayed in place of the hook's contents, and is exempt from all changers that would normally apply
			to the hook. This means that changers like (text-colour:), added to this changer, will ONLY apply
			to the hook once it's revealed, and not the link itself. To apply changers to just the link, consider wrapping it in a
			hook itself and using (link-style:), such as by the following:
			```
			(link-style: (text-colour:red))[(link:"Hands stained red")[Hands pure and dry :)]]
			```
			Alternatively, you can just use (enchant:) with `?Link` to enchant every link with the same changer.

			Example usage:

			Rationale:
			
			This is similar to (link:), but allows the created link to remain in the passage

			(link-goto: String, [String]) -> Command
			
			Takes a string of link text, and an optional destination passage name, and makes a command to create
			a link that takes the player to another passage. The link functions identically to a standard link.
			
			Example usage:
			* `(link-goto: "Enter the cellar", "Cellar")` is approximately the same as `[[Enter the cellar->Cellar]]`.
			* `(link-goto: "Cellar")` is the same as `[[Cellar]]`.

			Rationale:
			This macro serves as an alternative to the standard link syntax (`[[Link text->Destination]]`), and has a key difference:
			The link syntax lets you supply a fixed text string for the link, and a markup expression for the destination
			passage's name. (link-goto:) also allows the link text to be any expression - so, something like
			`(link-goto: "Move " + $name + "to the cellar", "Cellar")` can be written.

			Details:
			If the passage name doesn't correspond to any existing passage, a broken link (a red link that can't be clicked)
			will be created.

			The resulting command from this macro, like all commands, can be saved and used elsewhere.
			If you have a complicated link you need to use in several passages, you could (set:) it to a variable and use that variable
			in its place.

			As a bit of trivia... the Harlowe engine actually converts all standard links into (link-goto:) macro calls internally -
			the link syntax is, essentially, a syntactic shorthand for (link-goto:).

			Note that (link-goto:), unlike (link:), doesn't accept a changer value to style the produced link. This is because, as
			this produces a command (and not a changer), you can simply attach changers to the front of it to style the link.

			matches the passed-in 'where' lambda, or, if a number **n** was passed in, the **n**th (or, if negative, **n**thlast) open storylet.
			An optional final string can provide text to display when no such storylet is open currently.

			Example usage:
			```
			You look over the paddock as you ponder three ways you may spend the coming day.
			* (link-storylet: 1, "//(Unavailable)//")
			* (link-storylet: 2, "//(Unavailable)//")
			* (link-storylet: 3, "//(Unavailable)//")
			```

			Rationale:
			The standard macro for accessing which storylets are currently open in the story is (open-storylets:). Combined
			with other macros such as (for:) and (link-goto:), links to storylets can be easily created. This macro provides
			a shorthand for the most basic case: creating a simple link to the first open storylet, second open storylet, and so forth.

			Details:
			The position functions similarly to the position number given to (subarray:) - positive numbers will count from the start,
			and negative numbers will count from the end. `(link-storylet:-1)` will produce a link to the last available storylet (which
			will be the one with the *least* (urgency:) value among open storylets). If the number 0 is given, an error will result.

			If there is no storylet available for the link (such as `(link-storylet: 6)` when only 4 storylets are currently open) then
			the optional final string will be displayed. If it isn't given, nothing will be displayed.

			Note that (link-storylet:), unlike (link:), doesn't accept a changer value to style the produced link. This is because, as
			this produces a command (and not a changer), you can simply attach changers to the front of it to style the link.

		/*d:
			(link-undo: String, [String]) -> Command

			Takes a string of link text, and produces a link that, when clicked, undoes the current turn and
			sends the player back to the previously visited passage. The link appears identical to a typical
			passage link. An optional second string can be provided, which is shown instead of the link if it's not possible to undo.

			Example usage:
			`(link-undo:"Retreat", "Can't retreat!")` will produce a link reading "Retreat" if undos are available. If not,
			the text "Can't retreat!" is displayed instead.

			Rationale:
			The ability to undo the player's last turn, as an alternative to (go-to:), is explained in the documentation
			of the (undo:) macro. This macro provides a shorthand for placing (undo:) inside a (link:) attached hook.

			You may, as part of customising your story, be using (replace:) to change the ?sidebar, and remove its
			default "undo" link. If so, you can selectively provide undo links at certain parts of your story instead,
			by using this macro.

			Details:
			As with (undo:), (link-storylet:) and such, if undos aren't available (either due to this being the start of the story, or (forget-undos:) being used)
			then either the optional second string will be displayed instead, or (if that wasn't provided) nothing will be displayed.

			If this is used in a passage, and (forget-undos:) is used later in the passage to prevent undoing, then this link's text will automatically
			be replaced with the optional second string (or disappear if it's not provided). This is similar to how (link-fullscreen:) will
			update itself if another macro changes the player's fullscreen status.

			Note that (link-undo:), unlike (link:), doesn't accept a changer value to style the produced link. This is because, as
			this produces a command (and not a changer), you can simply attach changers to the front of it to style the link.

			(link-show: String, ...HookName) -> Command

			Creates a link that, when clicked, shows the given hidden hooks, running the code within.

			Example usage:
			`But those little quirks paled before (link-show: "her darker eccentricities.", ?twist)`

			Rationale:
			As discussed in the documentation for (show:), that macro is intended as a complement to (click-replace:) (or perhaps
			(click-append:)). While both let you insert text at a location when a link is clicked, they differ in whether they let the
			author write the initial text or the replacement text at the location when coding the passage.

			Typical (click-append:) usage resembles the following, where the inserted text provides supplementary content to the passage's
			prose, and is written separately from it:

			```
			Ah. You remember her eldest well - [a frail, anxious child]<extra|. Unlikely to raise too much of a fuss.

			(click-append: ?extra)[, constantly frowning, mumbling every word they utter, flinching at the slightest noise]
			```

			Conversely, typical (show:) usage resembles the following, where the inserted text is a continuation of the passage's prose,
			and is written together with it:

			```
			"Look, it's important to comment even the simplest code...|extra)[ You might remember what it does now, but not at 4:50 PM on Friday \
			afternoon, when you're about to push to production and a runtime error shows up in it.]"

			You (link-reveal:"struggle to listen.")[(show: ?extra)]
			```

			The (link-show:) macro provides a convenient shorthand for the latter example, letting you write the final line as
			`You (link-show: "struggle to listen.", ?more)`.

			Details:
			As with most link macros, providing this with an empty link text string will result in an error.

			As with (show:) and (click:), providing this with a hook which is already visible, or which doesn't even exist,
			will NOT produce an error, but simply do nothing. Also, showing a hook that was hidden with (hide:) will not re-run the
			macros contained within, but simply make visible the hook as it was.

			Note that (link-show:), unlike (link:), doesn't accept a changer value to style the produced link. This is because, as
			this produces a command (and not a changer), you can simply attach changers to the front of it to style the link.

		/*d:
			(link-fullscreen: String, String, [String]) -> Command

			Creates a link that, when clicked, toggles the browser's fullscreen mode and windowed mode. The first string is used as its link text
			if the browser is currently in windowed mode, and the second string if it's currently in fullscreen mode. The link will automatically update
			(re-rendering the link text) to match the browser's current fullscreen state. The optional third string is used when fullscreen mode isn't allowed
			by the browser - if it's absent or an empty string, the link won't be displayed at all in that situation.

			Example usage:
			* `(link-fullscreen: "Turn fullscreen on", "Turn fullscreen off", "Fullscreen unavailable")`

			Rationale:
			Modern browsers allow web pages to take up the entire screen of the user, in a manner similar to desktop games. This feature can be useful
			for immersive or moody stories, such as horror stories, that wish to immerse the player's senses in a certain colour or shade, or to display
			impactful text that doesn't have to compete for attention from any other screen elements. While it can be more convenient to place an (icon-fullscreen:)
			in your story's sidebar, this macro can be useful if you remove or replace the sidebar with something else, and can serve as an alternative
			means of activating fullscreen mode.

			The third string is an error message or alternative text you can provide if the browser doesn't allow fullscreen mode to be entered, for whatever reason.
			If you're using this link in the middle of a sentence, you may want to use this to provide an alternative sentence fragment to fit the sentence.

			Details:
			When activated, this will make the page's `<html>` element be the fullscreen element, *not* `<tw-story>`. This is because, in most browsers,
			removing the fullscreen element from the page, however briefly, will deactivate fullscreen mode. Since the `(enchant:)` macro, when given ?Page,
			will often need to wrap `<tw-story>` in another element, those macro calls will deactivate fullscreen mode if `<tw-story>` was the fullscreen element.
			So, if you have edited the compiled HTML to add elements before and after it, such as a navigation bar, that will remain visible while the story
			is in fullscreen mode. Additionally, this means that the Debug Mode panel is still visible when fullscreen mode is activated.

			If the third string is present, and the browser reports to Harlowe that fullscreen mode is unavailable, then a string visually identical to
			a broken link will be displayed, using the third string as its text. This is, by default, a red link that cannot be clicked.

			Currently, there is no special functionality or error reporting when the browser reports that fullscreen mode is available, but the attempt
			to switch to fullscreen mode fails. In that case, the link will simply appear to do nothing.

			It is possible to "force" the player into fullscreen by nesting the code for a (goto:) call inside the second string, such as by
			`(link-fullscreen: "Continue.", "(goto:'Area 2')")`, which causes the (goto:) to be run only when the browser enters fullscreen mode,
			then immediately leaving the passage and continuing the story. This is NOT recommended, however, because browsers currently (as of 2020) allow
			the user to exit fullscreen mode at any time of their own accord, so a player that's not willing to enter fullscreen mode would simply exit
			it soon afterward, and this construction would ultimately accomplish very little.

			Note that (link-fullscreen:), unlike (link:), doesn't accept a changer value to style the produced link. This is because, as
			this produces a command (and not a changer), you can simply attach changers to the front of it to style the link.
