		Commands like (display:), (print:), (link:), (show:) and so on are used to print data or an interactive
		element into the passage. These elements can be styled like hooks, by attaching changers to the macro,
		as if it was a hook.

		In addition to their visual appearance, you can also change what passage transitions links use,
		by applying (t8n-depart:) and (t8n-arrive:). (Note that since normal passage links are identical to the
		(link-goto:) macro, you can also attach changers to passage links.)

		/*d:
			(set: ...VariableToValue) -> Instant
			
			Stores data values in variables, optionally allowing you to permanently restrict the variable to a single datatype.
			
			Example usage:
			* `(set: $battlecry to "Save a " + $favouritefood + " for me!")` creates a variable called $battlecry containing a string.
			* `(set: _dist to $altitude - $enemyAltitude)` creates a temp variable called _dist.
			* `(set: num-type $funds to 0)` sets a variable and restricts its type to numbers, preventing non-numbers
			from ever being (set:) into it by accident.
			* `(set: const-type $robotText to (font:"Courier New"))` sets a variable and makes it so it can't ever be set
			to another value.
			* `(set: (p-either:"Ms.","Mr.","Mx.")-type $charTitle to "Mx.")` sets a variable that can only hold the strings "Mr.", "Ms." or "Mx.".

			Rationale:
			
			Variables are data storage for your game. You can store data values under special names
			of your choosing, and refer to them later.

			There are two kinds of variables. Normal variables, whose names begin with `$`, persist between passages,
			and should be used to store data that will be needed throughout the entire game. Temp variables,
			whose names begin with `_`, only exist inside the hook or passage that they're first (set:), and
			are forgotten after the hook or passage ends. You should use temp variables if you're writing passage
			code that mustn't accidentally affect any other passages' variables (by using (set:) on a variable name
			that someone else was using for something different). This can be essential in collaborative work
			with other authors working on the same story independently, or when writing code to be used in multiple stories.

			The following example demonstrates where temp variables are usable.
			```
			(set: _a to 1) <- This is usable everywhere in this passage.
			[
				(set: _b to 1) <-- This is only usable inside this hook.
				(set: _a to it + 1) <-- This changes the outer _a variable.
				[
					(print: _a + _b) <-- You can refer to both _a or _b in this hook.
				]
			]
			(print: _b) <-- This will cause an error.
			```
			
			Variables have many purposes: keeping track of what the player has accomplished,
			managing some other state of the story, storing hook styles and changers, and
			other such things. You can display variables by putting them in passage text,
			attach them to hooks, and create and change them using the (set:) and (put:) macros.
			
			Details:
			
			Even though named hooks' names are case-insensitive, variable names are case-sensitive. So, `$Chips` and `$chips` are considered
			different variables.

			In its basic form, a variable is created or changed using `(set: ` variable `to` value `)`.
			You can also set multiple variables in a single (set:) by separating each VariableToValue
			with commas: `(set: $weapon to 'hands', $armour to 'naked')`, etc. **Note**: currently,
			each value in a VariableToValue is evaluated before any of them are stored in their variables.
			This means that, for instance, `(set: $olives to 5)(set: $olives to 2, $grapes to $olives - 1)` will,
			in the second (set:) call, cause `2` and `$olives - 1` to be evaluted to `2` and `5 - 1` (i.e. 4) before
			being put in $olives and $grapes, respectively. This may change in a future version of Harlowe.
			
			You can also use `it` in expressions on the right-side of `to`. Much as in other
			expressions, it's a shorthand for what's on the left side: `(set: $vases to it + 1)`
			is a shorthand for `(set: $vases to $vases + 1)`.

			Due to the variable syntax potentially conflicting with dollar values (such as $1.50) in your story text,
			variables cannot begin with a numeral.

			Typed variables:

			A common source of errors in a story is when a variable holding one type of data is mistakenly overridden
			with a different type of data, such as when putting `"1"` (the string "1") into a variable that should
			hold numbers. A good way to guard against this is to make the variable a **typed variable**, which is permanently
			restricted to a single datatype. The first time you set data to the variable, write `(set: num-type $days to 1)` to
			permanently restrict $days to numbers. That way, if you accidentally put `"1"` into it, an error will appear
			immediately, explaining the issue. Moreover, typed variables serve a code documentation purpose: they help
			indicate and explain the purpose of a variable by showing what data is meant to be in it. You can use any
			datatype before the `-type` syntax - see the article about datatype data for more details.

			In addition to just restricting a variable to a type, you may wish to specify that a variable should only hold one
			value for the entire story - a style changer, for instance, or a datamap holding fixed values for a
			procedural-generation algorithm. For these, you want to use the `const` (short for "constant") datatype.
			Using this, the variable is guaranteed to constantly hold that value for the entirety of the story (or, if it's
			a temp variable, the passage or hook).

		/*d:
			(put: ...VariableToValue) -> Instant
			
			A left-to-right version of (set:) that requires the word `into` rather than `to`.
			
			Example usage:
			* `(put: "Save a " + $favouritefood + " for me!" into $battlecry)` creates a variable called $battlecry.
			* `(put: $altitude - $enemyAltitude into _dist)` creates a temp variable called _dist.
			* `(put: 0 into num-type $funds)` sets a variable and restricts its type to numbers, preventing non-numbers
			from ever being (put:) into it by accident.
			* `(put: (font:"Courier New") into const-type $robotText)` sets a variable and makes it so it can't ever be set
			to another value.

			Rationale:
			
			This macro has an identical purpose to (set:) - it creates and changes variables.
			For a basic explanation, see the rationale for (set:).
			
			Almost every programming language has a (set:) construct, and most of these place the
			variable on the left-hand-side. However, a minority, such as HyperTalk, place the variable
			on the right. Harlowe allows both to be used, depending on personal preference. (set:) reads
			as `(set: ` variable `to` value `)`, and (put:) reads as `(put: ` value `into` variable `)`.
			
			Details:
			
			Just as with (set:), a variable is changed using `(put: ` value `into` variable `)`. You can
			also set multiple variables in a single (put:) by separating each VariableToValue
			with commas: `(put: 2 into $batteries, 4 into $bottles)`, etc.

			You can also use typed variables with (put:) - `(put: 1 into num-type $days)` permanently
			restricts $days to numbers. Consult the article about (set:) for more information about
			typed variables.
			
			`it` can also be used with (put:), but, interestingly, it's used on the right-hand side of
			the expression: `(put: $eggs + 2 into it)`.

		/*d:
			(unpack: ...VariableToValue) -> Instant

			A specialised variation of (put:) that lets you extract multiple values from an array, datamap or string, at once, and put them into
			multiple variables, by placing a matching data structure on the right of `into` containing variables at
			the positions of those values. For instance, `(unpack: (a: 1, 2, 3) into (a: $x, 2, $y))` sets $x to 1 and $y to 3,
			and `(unpack: (dm: "B", 3, "A", 1) into (dm: "A", $x, "B", $y))` sets $x to 1 and $y to 3. 

			Example usage:
			* `(unpack: (a:"north","northeast","south") into (a: _mainPath, _sidePath, _backPath))` sets three temp variables,
			by overwriting each variable in the array on the right with its matching value in the array on the left.
			* `(unpack: $characterStats into (dm: "Maths", _Maths, "Science", _Science))` is the same as `(set: _Maths to $characterStats's Maths, _Science to $characterStats's Science)`.
			* `(unpack: "The Safecracker" into (p:"The ", str-type _job))` extracts the string "Safecracker" from the value, and puts it in the variable _job.
			* `(unpack: (a: "Daria", 25, 14, 25) into (a: str, ...num-type $stats))` extracts the numbers from the left side into a new array stored in $stats.

			Rationale:

			Extracting values from data structures into variables using just the (set:) and (put:) macros can be rather cumbersome, especially if you need to extract
			values from the same array or datamap. The (unpack:) macro provides a means to efficiently access multiple values in such structures, by describing the locations of those values within
			the structure - if you want to obtain the first, second, and fourth values in an array and put them into $a, $b and $c, just write `(a: $a, $b, any, $c)`, in exactly those positions,
			to the right of `into`. The visual clarity of this can provide great assistance in understanding and reminding you of what the data structure is, and the relationship of the destination variables to
			their source values.

			The (unpack:) macro also lets you use string patterns (produced by (p:) and other such macros) to unpack strings into multiple components. To obtain all the digit characters at the
			start of a string, and nothing else, and put them into $a, just write `(p: ...digit-type $a)`. No long-winded (for:) loops and individual character checks are needed - simply describe the
			string using the pattern macros, using typed variables to mark parts to extract, and they can be easily extracted.

			Details:

			Harlowe checks that each value on the right side (henceforth called the "pattern side") has a value that matches it (using the same rules as the `matches` operator)
			on the left side (the "data side"), and overwrites the pattern side with the data side, causing the variables at various positions in the pattern side to be overwritten with values from
			the data. (Remember that datamaps' "positions" are determined by their datanames, not their locations in the (dm:) macro that created them, as,
			unlike arrays, they are not sequential.)

			For extracting substrings from strings, use the (p:) macro and its related macros to construct a string pattern, resembling
			array patterns. For instance, `(unpack: "Slime Ball" into (p: (p-either: "Silt", "Mud", "Peat", "Slime")-type _element, " ", (p-either: "Ball", "Blast", "Shot", "Beam")-type _shape))`
			extracts the words "Slime" and "Ball" from the value, and puts them in the _element and _shape temp variables. Note that
			when this is done, the _element variable is restricted to `(p-either: "Silt", "Mud", "Peat", "Slime")-type` data, so putting
			any other kind of string into it will cause an error. Generally, it's recommended to use temp variables for string destructuring, and then,
			if you need more general variables to hold the extracted substrings, place them in a less restricted variable afterward.

			Note that the pattern side's data structure can have any number of nested data structures inside it.
			`(unpack:  (a: (a: 1), 2, (dm: "A", 3)) into (a: (a: $x), 2, (dm: "A", $y)))` also sets $x to 1 and $y to 3. If you need to reach deeply
			into a data structure (such as one produced by (passages:), (saved-games:) or (open-storylets:)) to get a certain set of values,
			this can come in handy.

			You may have noticed that the data structures on the pattern side may have values that aren't variable names, such as the 2 in the
			preceding example. These can be used as error-checking values - if a matching value isn't present on the right side at that same position,
			then an error will be reported. To ensure that the data side does indeed contain the values you expect it to, you may include these
			values in the pattern side. Of course, you may want to simply enforce that a value of a given datatype is in that position, rather a specific
			value - this can be done by placing a datatype name at that position, like `num` or `str` or `empty`. Consult the datatype article for more
			information on datatype names.

			As you may have also noticed, this syntax is convenient for extracting values from the left side of arrays. But, what if you wish to only select
			values from the middle, or to skip certain values without putting them in variables? You could use a value or a datamap name at that position,
			such as by writing `(set: (a: num, $y, $x) to $array)` - though, if you aren't even certain of the data types that could be at those positions,
			you may find the special `any` data type to be a big help - `(set: (a: any, $y, $x) to $array)` sets $x to the 3rd value in $array and $y to the
			2nd value, without needing to worry about what the first value might be.

			(When dealing with string patterns, the equivalent of `any` is simply `str`, as strings can't contain non-string data.)

			This syntax can be combined with typed variables - simply place the typed variable where a normal variable would be
			within the pattern side. `(unpack: $array into (a: num, num-type $y, num-type _x))` not only sets $y and _x, but it also
			restricts them to number data, all in one statement. If the typed variable is inside an array, and involves a spread datatype (like `...num`)
			then it is restricted to data that matches `(a: ...num)` (i.e. arrays of zero or more `num` values), and it automatically gathers multiple values from the
			right-hand-side that match the datatype. `(set: (a: str, ...bool-type $examAnswers) to (a: "ANSWER KEY", true, false, false, true, false))`
			sets $examAnswers to `(a:true, false, false, true, false)`.
			
			If the destination doesn't contain any variables - for instance, if you write `(unpack: (a:2,3) into (a:3,2))` - then an error will be printed.

			For obvious reasons, (unpack:) can't be used with datasets - you'll have to convert them to arrays on the right side.

		/*d:
			(move: ...VariableToValue) -> Instant
			
			A variant of (put:) that, if transferring data from a data structure, deletes the source value
			after copying it - in effect moving the value from the source to the destination.
			
			Example usage:
			* `(move: $arr's 1st into $var)`

			Rationale:
			You'll often use data structures such as arrays or datamaps as storage for values
			that you'll only use once, such as a list of names to print out. When it comes time
			to use them, you can remove it from the structure and retrieve it in one go.

			Details:
			You must use the `into` keyword, like (put:), with this macro. This is because, like (put:),
			the destination of the value is on the right, whereas the source is on the left.

			As with (set:) and (put:), you can also change multiple variables in a single (move:) by
			separating each VariableToValue with commas: `(move: $a's 1st into $b, $a's 2nd into $c)`, etc. Also,
			unpacking syntax (described in detail in (unpack:)'s article) can be used with (move:) as well -
			`(move: $array into (a: $x, $y))` will cause only the first and second values of $array to be moved into $x and $y.

			If the data value you're accessing cannot be removed - for instance, if it's an array's `length` -
			then an error will be produced.

			This macro works very well with the `random` data value of arrays: `(move: $deck's random into $card)`
			will remove a random value from $deck and put it into $card. Thus, you can use arrays as random "decks"
			of values that you can draw from and use once in your story.

			Note that this will only delete the data from the source if the source is inside a data structure.
			Moving from variable to variable, such as by `(move:$p into $q)`, won't cause $p to be deleted.

			Just as with (set:) or (put:), typed variables can also be used with the destination variable of (move:).
			Writing `(move: $enemies's 1st into dm-type $currentEnemy)` will move a datamap from $enemies's 1st and
			put it into $currentEnemy, while also restricting $currentEnemy to datamap data for the rest of the story.
			Note that if $enemies's 1st is not, in fact, a datamap, an error will result.

			Example usage:

			Rationale:
			Suppose you have a section of code or source that you need to include in several different

			text like `[A (font: ) command]`. You may find this useful for debugging purposes.
			
			This command can be stored in a variable instead of being performed immediately.
			Notably, the expression to print is stored inside the command, instead of being
			re-evaluated when it is finally performed. So, a passage
			that contains:
			```
			(set: $name to "Dracula")
			(set: $p to (print: "Count " + $name))
			(set: $name to "Alucard")

			```
			will still result in the text `Count Dracula`. This is not particularly useful

			Note that, once stored in a variable, a (print:) command is not a string. So, you

			Example usage:
			* `(v6m-print: "<sarcasm>" + $quip + "</sarcasm>")` prints out the string `"<sarcasm>"`, the string contents of `$quip`, and the string `"</sarcasm>"`,
			without interpreting that as HTML markup.
			* `(set: $name to (v6m-print: (prompt: "Enter your name:", "")))` prompts the player for their name, then

			Rationale:
			In practice, this is functionally identical to a (verbatim:) changer attached to a (print:) command. However, one major
			difference is that this can be stored in a variable and used in passage prose by itself, without having to
			attach the changer each time. This scenario is especially useful when dealing with player-inputted text:

			(go-to: String) -> Command
			This command stops passage code and sends the player to a new passage, starting a new turn
			as if a passage link was clicked. If the passage named by the string does not exist, this produces an error.
			
			Example usage:
			`(go-to: "The Distant Future")`
			
			Rationale:
			There are plenty of occasions where you may want to instantly advance to a new
			passage without the player's volition. (go-to:) provides access to this ability.
			
			(go-to:) can accept any expression which evaluates to
			a string. You can, for instance, go to a randomly selected passage by combining it with
			(either:) - `(go-to: (either: "Win", "Lose", "Draw"))`.
			
			(go-to:) can be combined with (link:) to accomplish the same thing as (link-goto:):
			`(link:"Enter the hole")[(go-to:"Falling")]` However, you
			can include other macros inside the hook to run before the (go-to:), such as (set:),
			(put:) or (save-game:).
			
			Details:

			You can attach changers like (t8n-depart:) and (t8n-arrive:) to this to
			alter the transition animation used when (go-to:) activates. Other kinds of changers
			won't do anything, though.

			If it is performed, (go-to:) will "halt" the passage and prevent any macros and text
			after it from running. So, a passage that contains:
			```
			(set: $listen to "I love")
			(go-to: "Train")
			(set: $listen to it + " you")
			```
			will *not* cause `$listen` to become `"I love you"` when it runs.

			You should generally avoid using (go-to:) unconditionally in the passage - that is, avoid using it such
			that it would immediately run when the player enters, regardless of anything. This has a few side-effects:
			it makes it difficult to use (undo:) to return to this passage, and it counts as a new turn for the "turns" identifier even
			though the player didn't do or see anything. You can use (redirect:) in place of (go-to:) to avoid these issues.

			If you simply want to go back to the previous passage, forgetting the current turn, then you may use (undo:).

			(redirect: String) -> Command
			This command sends the player to a new passage. However, unlike (goto:), this does
			*not* start a new turn - undoing after this will send the player to the turn before the
			redirect occurred.
			
			Example usage:
			`(redirect: "Workdesk")`
			
			Rationale:
			(go-to:) is useful for transferring the player to a new passage after performing some
			interaction or waiting for some (event:), but is less useful for
			transferring the player from a passage unconditionally. Attempting to undo a turn, using
			(undo:) or (link-undo:), will simply cause the (go-to:) to activate again immediately,
			nullifying the attempt to undo the turn.

			While it's possible to use (display:) in place of a (go-to:), displaying the next passage
			instead of navigating to it, there are a few problems: the displayed passage won't be the name
			produced by (passage:), it won't be present in the (history:) array, the header and footer passages
			won't be re-run, and, of course, the text of the original passage remains onscreen.

			(redirect:) exists as an alternative to (go-to:) that avoids these problems. Furthermore,
			a use of (redirect:) typically indicates to other readers of the code that the change of passages is for
			technical reasons, not for in-story reasons, so the meaning of the two is distinct.

			Details:
			When a (redirect:) macro is used, the departing passage (the one containing the (redirect:) call)
			remains in the (history:) array, and is still considered visited by `visits`. However, no additional
			turn will result, and `turns` will not be affected.

			Also, temp variables that were (set:) in the departing passage will not be accessible in the new passage.

			Transition changers that can be attached to (go-to:) can be attached to (redirect:), including
			(t8n-depart:) and (t8n-arrive:).

			If it is performed, (redirect:) will "halt" the passage and prevent any macros and text
			after it from running. So, a passage that contains:
			```
			(set: $listen to "I love")
			(redirect: "Train")
			(set: $listen to it + " you")
			```
			will *not* cause `$listen` to become `"I love you"` when it runs.

			Example usage:
			`You scurry back whence you came... (after:2s)[(undo:)]` will undo the current turn after 2 seconds.

			Rationale:
			The (go-to:) macro sends players to different passages instantly. But, it's common to want to
			send players back to the passage they previously visited, acting as if this turn never happened.
			(undo:) provides this functionality.

			By default, Harlowe offers a button in its sidebar that lets players undo at any time, going
			back to the beginning of the game session. However, if you wish to use this macro, and only permit undos
			in certain passages and occasions, you may remove the button by using (replace:) on the ?sidebar in
			a header tagged passage.

			Details:
			You can attach changers like (t8n-depart:) and (t8n-arrive:) to this to
			alter the transition animation used when (undo:) activates. Other kinds of changers
			won't do anything, though.

			* `(after-error: )[(debug:)]` causes Debug Mode to open if any error occurs in the current passage. This is best used in a "header" or
			"footer" tagged passage.

			Rationale:
			Designed for use in testing, this macro allows you to selectively open the Debug Mode panel at certain parts of the game, after having played through
			the game normally without its presence. It's designed especially for use with (after-error:) - combining them as in the example above will allow
			you to start debugging immediately upon any error occurring.

			Details:
			Note that, to ensure that Harlowe runs at optimal performance, some Debug Mode features will not be immediately available if the panel is opened mid-game.
			In particular, the "replay" dialogs (available in Debug View) won't be available for macros and variables that have already been rendered prior to
			the panel opening.

			Using this macro will *not* cause the contents of passages tagged with "debug-header" or "debug-footer" to suddenly be added to the current passage. However,

			(icon-undo: [String], [String]) -> Command

			Creates an icon, similar to those in the sidebar, that, if visible and clicked, undoes the current turn, returning to the previous passage, as if by (undo:). It is not
			visible if undos aren't available.

			Example usage:
			* `(replace:?sidebar)[(icon-undo: )(size:2)[(str-repeated:$flowers + 1, "✿ ")]]` alters the sidebar such that there is only an undo button, followed
			by a number of `✿ ` symbols equal to the number in $flowers plus 1. The space separating each florette symbol allows it to word-wrap normally. This would
			best be used in a "header" or "footer" tagged passage.
			* `(icon-undo:"👈")` creates an element that uses &#128072; as its icon instead of the default.
			* `(icon-undo:"Undo the turn")` creates an element with the label "Undo the turn" under it.
			* `(icon-undo:"👈", "Undo the turn")` combines both of the above.

			Rationale:
			By default, each passage in a Harlowe story features a narrow sidebar to the left, housing "Undo" and "Redo" menu icons.
			However, using the (replace:), (append:) or (prepend:) changers with the ?sidebar HookName, it is possible to dynamically change
			the sidebar, inserting or replacing its contents with any kind of prose. To that end, it is useful to be able to recreate
			the "Undo" and "Redo" menu icons exactly as they were, in case an earlier operation performed on the sidebar had removed them.

			Details:
			Of course, you can use this in normal passage prose, if you wish - they are merely commands, just like (link-goto:) or (print:).

			If you wish to change the icon to a different symbol, you may provide a string containing a single character to this macro.
			If none is given, the default symbol is &#8630; (in HTML, `&#8630;`).

			You may also provide a string that contains a label for the icon. This label must have more than one character in it (so that it isn't
			confused with the optional icon string) and will be placed beneath the icon. The label's contents will NOT be interpreted as Harlowe markup, so
			everything in it will be used verbatim for the label. This is because, unlike links, the label isn't considered part of passage prose.

			If both strings given to this macro have more than one character in them, an error will result.

			This command creates an element that uses the same default CSS styling as the sidebar's icons: a `<tw-icon>` holding a glyph of text at 66px font size,
			with 0.2 opacity that changes to 0.4 when hovered over.

			Like all sidebar icons, these will automatically hide themselves when they cannot be clicked, leaving a conspicuous space. In the
			case of the "Undo" icon, it will be hidden if it's the first turn of the game, and there is nothing to undo - or if (forget-undos:)
			is used to prevent undos. If this is used in a passage, and (forget-undos:) is used later in the passage to prevent undoing, then this will automatically,

			* `(icon-fullscreen:"▢")` creates an element that uses &#9634; as its icon instead of the default.
			* `(icon-fullscreen:"Fullscreen")` creates an element with the label "Fullscreen" under it.
			* `(icon-fullscreen:"▢", "Fullscreen")` combines both of the above.

			Rationale:
			By default, each passage in a Harlowe story features a narrow sidebar to the left, housing "Undo" and "Redo" menu icons.
			However, other functions may be desirable to have available to the player at all times, such as the capability to toggle fullscreen mode in the browser.
			While you could place a (link-fullscreen:) or (checkbox-fullscreen:) in your passage prose, placing the icon produced by this macro is a slightly more concise solution that fits with
			the use of the sidebar for view utility commands.

			Details:
			Of course, you can use this in normal passage prose, if you wish - they are merely commands, just like (link-goto:) or (print:).

			If you wish to change the icon to a different symbol, you may provide a string containing a single character to this macro.

			This command creates an element that uses the same default CSS styling as the sidebar's icons: a `<tw-icon>` holding a glyph of text at 66px font size,
			with 0.2 opacity that changes to 0.4 when hovered over.

			When activated, this will make the page's `<html>` element be the fullscreen element, *not* `<tw-story>`. This is because, in most browsers,
			removing the fullscreen element from the page, however briefly, will deactivate fullscreen mode. Since the `(enchant:)` macro, when given ?Page,
			will often need to wrap `<tw-story>` in another element, those macro calls will deactivate fullscreen mode if `<tw-story>` was the fullscreen element.
			So, if you have edited the compiled HTML to add elements before and after it, such as a navigation bar, that will remain visible while the story
			is in fullscreen mode. Additionally, this means that the Debug Mode panel is still visible when fullscreen mode is activated.

			If the browser reports to Harlowe that fullscreen mode is unavailable, then the icon will be hidden, leaving a conspicuous space.

			* `(icon-restart:"⟲")` creates an element that uses &#27F2; as its icon instead of the default.
			* `(icon-restart:"Restart")` creates an element with the label "Restart" under it.
			* `(icon-restart:"⟲", "Restart")` combines both of the above.

			However, other functions may be desirable to have available to the player at all times, such as an option to restart the story from the beginning.
			This would be best suited to short stories with a high density of random or branching content, such as a story with dozens of options that ends after
			a certain number of turns, or a procedurally generated puzzle with a lot of dead-ends.

			Details:

		* `(set: $satchel to (dm:"tomato",2))(prepend: ?sidebar)[(icon-counter: bind $satchel's tomato, "Tomato", "Tomatoes")]` creates a counter element labeled `"Tomatoes"` if `$satchel's tomato` contains a number other than
		1, and `"Tomato"` otherwise.

		Rationale:
		The sidebar for Harlowe stories contains two basic gameplay utility functions by default – an (icon-undo:) button and an (icon-redo:) button – and can have more such buttons added using
		the other icon-related macros, along with changers such as (append:) and (prepend:), and ideally in a header or footer tagged passage. But, one can also use that space to hold status
		information relevant to the player. If the game features a number of vital numeric values, such as a score or a resource count, having that value be in constant view, and in a relatively consistent
		screen position, can be very helpful in keeping the player aware of their current status.

		This element is visually optimised toward small, whole numeric values, such as the whole numbers from 0 to 100. Numbers with a greater number of decimal places than that can be
		used, but they will likely exceed the width of the sidebar. Furthermore, decimal places in the value will not be displayed, but will be rounded using the (trunc:) algorithm.

		Details:
		The optional second string allows for you to provide singular and plural forms of the counter label, which change based on whether the counter is 1 or -1. The first string becomes the
		singular form of the label, and the second string serves as the plural.

		Unlike the other icon-related commands, which create clickable icons, the element this creates cannot be clicked, and is designed to be fully visible at all times. Thus,
		it does not have 30% opacity by default, but instead has 100% opacity. You may attach the (opacity:) changer to it to lower its opacity, if you wish.

		The font used for this element, by default, is Verdana (and falls back to the browser's default sans-serif font family). This is intended to visually differentiate this counter
		from story prose, which uses a serif font by default.

		If, when the element is created, the bound variable is not a number, then an error will result.
		However, if the bound variable ever changes to a non-number data value after that, then the counter will simply not update, instead of producing an error.

	/*d:
		(meter: Bind, Number, String, [String], [Colour or Gradient]) -> Command

		A command that creates a horizontal bar-graph meter, showing the current value of a number variable, relative to a maximum value, and updating it whenever
		that variable changes.

		Example usage:
		* `(set:$batteryPower to 800)(meter: bind $batteryPower, 1000, "X", "Battery Power: $batteryPower", (gradient: 90, 0, red, 1, orange))` creates a centered meter showing the value of the $batteryPower variable,
		from 0 to 1000, using a gradient from orange (full) to red (empty).
		* `(set:$threatLevel to 2)(b4r:'solid')(meter: bind $threatLevel, 10, "==X", red)` creates a right-aligned meter showing the value of the $threatLevel variable,
		from 0 to 10, in red, with a solid border.

		Rationale:
		For those making number-heavy games, presenting those numbers in an immediately recognisable fashion can be essential to a smooth game experience - and there are times when simply
		stating the numbers in the prose isn't as direct as you'd like. The standard videogame UI meter, a bar that fills with a colour to represent an important value, is a
		visual idiom familiar to many people. In addition to their familiarity, meters have important semantic value, too - simply by graphically presenting a value in a meter,
		a player can immediately get a sense of how important to their play session that value is, as well as understand what numeric range that value should occupy during play.

		Details:
		The meter will graph the value of the bound variable, from 0 to the given maximum value number (which must be positive). For instance, if that number is 20, then if the bound variable is 5,
		the meter bar will be 25% full.

		As of Harlowe 3.3.0, using the `2bind` keyword instead of `bind` will produce an error.

		The meter is a "box" element, which takes up the full width of the passage or hook in which it's contained. Placing it inside column markup can
		allow you to place text alongside it, or other (meter:) commands, if you so desire.

		The first string you give to this macro is a "sizing line" identical to that accepted by (box:) and (input-box:) - consult their documentation for more
		information about those lines. However, the sizing line also determines the direction that the meter's bar fills. If the meter is left-aligned or
		occupies the full width (by being given "X" as a sizing string), the bar fills from left (empty) to right (full), and the opposite is true for
		right-alignment. Centre-alignment causes the bar to fill from the centre, expanding outward in both directions.

		The second, optional string is a label that is placed inside the meter, on top of the bar. This text is aligned in the same direction as the meter itself.
		Whenever the meter updates, the label is also re-rendered.

		Either a colour or a gradient can be given as the final value, with which to colour the bar. If neither is given, the bar will be a simple gray.
		If a gradient is given, and it isn't a (stripes:) gradient, its rotation will be automatically changed to 90 degrees, with the leftmost colour
		(at colour stop 0) being placed at the "empty" end of the meter, and the rightmost colour (at colour stop 1) placed at the "full" end. If the bar
		is center-aligned, then the gradient will be modified, with both ends of the graph having the leftmost colour, and the center having the rightmost colour.

		The meter is exclusively horizontal, and cannot be rotated unless you attach (text-rotate:) to it.

		Note: In Internet Explorer 10, the vertical height of the meter may be lower than as drawn in other browsers. This is due to a CSS limitation in that browser.

		/*d:
			(cycling-link: [Bind], ...String) -> Command

			A command that, when evaluated, creates a cycling link - a link which does not go anywhere, but changes its own text
			to the next in a looping sequence of strings, and sets the optional bound variable to match the string value of the text.

			Example usage:
			* `(cycling-link: bind $head's hair, "Black", "Brown", "Blonde", "Red", "White")` binds the "hair" value in the $head datamap to the
			current link text.
			* `(cycling-link: "Mew", "Miao", "Mrr", "Mlem")` has no bound variable.
			* `(cycling-link: 2bind $pressure, "Low", "Medium", "High")` has a two-way bound variable. Whenever $pressure is either "Low", "Medium",
			or "High", the link will change its text automatically to match.

			Rationale:
			The cycling link is an interaction idiom popularised in Twine 1 which combines the utility of a dial input element with
			the discovery and visual consistency of a link: the player can typically only discover that this is a cycling link by clicking it,
			and can then discover the full set of labels by clicking through them. This allows a variety of subtle dramatic and humourous
			possibilities, and moreover allows the link to sit comfortably among passage prose without standing out as an interface element.

			The addition of a variable bound to the link, changing to match whichever text the player finally dialed the link to, allows
			cycling links to affect subsequent passages, and thus for the link to be just as meaningful in affecting the story's course as any
			other, even though no hooks and (set:)s can be attached to them.

			Details:

			This macro accepts two-way binds using the `2bind` syntax. These will cause the link to rotate its values to match the current value of the bound
			variable, if it can - if $pressure is "Medium" when entering the passage with `(cycling-link: 2bind $pressure, "Low", "Medium", "High")`, then it will
			rotate "Medium" to the front, as if the link had already been clicked once. Also, it will automatically update itself whenever
			any other macro changes the bound variable. However, if the variable no longer matches any of the link's strings, then it won't update - for
			instance, if the variable becomes "It's Gonna Blow", then a cycling link with the strings "Low", "Medium" and "High" won't update.

			If one of the strings is empty, such as `(cycling-link: "Two eggs", "One egg", "")`, then upon reaching the empty string, the link
			will disappear permanently. If the *first* string is empty, an error will be produced (because then the link can never appear at all).

			If attempting to render one string produces an error, such as `(cycling-link: "Goose", "(print: 2 + 'foo')")`, then the error will only appear
			once the link cycles to that string.

			The bound variable will be set to the first value as soon as the cycling link is displayed - so, even if the player doesn't
			interact with the link at all, the variable will still have the intended value.

			If the bound variable has already been given a type restriction (such as by `(set:num-type $candy to 1)`), then, if that type isn't `string` or `str`, an error
			will result.

			If you use (replace:) to alter the text inside a (cycling-link:), such as `(cycling-link: bind $tattoo, "Star", "Feather")(replace:"Star")[Claw]`,
			then the link's text will be changed, but the value assigned to the bound variable will *not* - $tattoo will still be "Star", and clicking the
			link twice will return the link's text to "Star". This differs from (dropdown:)'s behaviour in this situation.

			If only one string was given to this macro, an error will be produced.

			Added in: 3.0.0
			#input and interface 1
		*/
		/*d:
			(seq-link: [Bind], ...String) -> Command
			Also known as: (sequence-link:)

			A command that creates a link that does not go anywhere, but changes its own text to the next in a sequence of strings, becoming plain text once the final
			string is reached, and setting the optional bound variable to match the text at all times.

			Example usage:
			* `(seq-link: bind $candy, "Two candies", "One candy", "Some wrappers")` sets the $candy variable to always equal the currently displayed string. "Some wrappers", the final
			string, becomes plain text instead of a link.
			* `(seq-link: "We nodded,", "turned,", "and departed, not a word spoken")` has no bound variable.

			Rationale:
			This is a variation of the (cycling-link:) command macro that does not cycle - for more information about that macro,
			see its corresponding article. This is a simpler macro, being simply a link that changes when clicked without looping, albeit less useful as
			a means of obtaining the player's input.

			While it's possible to produce this effect by simply using (link:) and nesting it, such as by `(link:"We nodded,")[(link:"turned,")[and departed, not a word spoken]]`,
			this macro is much more convenient to write when you wish to use a large amount of link labels. Additionally, this macro allows a bound variable to
			keep track of which string the player viewed last, as with (cycling-link:), which would be slightly more complicated to track using (link:) and (set:).

			Details:
			If one of the strings is empty, such as `(seq-link: "Two eggs", "One egg", "")`, then upon reaching the empty string, the link
			will disappear permanently. If the *first* string is empty, an error will be produced (because then the link can never appear at all).

			If attempting to render one string produces an error, such as `(seq-link: "Goose", "(print: 2 + 'foo')")`, then the error will only appear
			once the link cycles to that string.

			The bound variable will be set to the first value as soon as the sequence link is displayed - so, even if the player doesn't
			interact with the link at all, the variable will still have the intended value.

			If the bound variable has already been given a type restriction (such as by `(set:num-type $candy to 1)`), then, if that type isn't `string` or `str`, an error
			will result.

			If you use (replace:) to alter the text inside a (seq-link:), such as `(seq-link: bind $candy, "Two candies", "One candy", "Some wrappers")(replace:"Two")[Five]`,
			then the link's text will be changed, but the value assigned to the bound variable will *not* - $candy will still be "Two candies" until the link is clicked.

			If only one string was given to this macro, an error will be produced.

		customisation" screens and other non-narrative purposes, that same imagery can also be a good reason to use them within prose
		itself - for instance, to present an in-story bureaucratic form or machine control panel.

		Details:

		This macro accepts two-way binds using the `2bind` syntax. These will cause the dropdown to always match the current value of the bound
		variable, if it can. Also, it will automatically update itself whenever any other macro changes the bound variable. However,
		if the variable no longer matches any of the dropdown's strings, then it won't update - for
		instance, if the variable becomes "Peasant", then a dropdown with the strings "Duke", "King" and "Emperor" won't update.

		Note that unlike (cycling-link:), another command that uses bound variables, the bound variable is mandatory here.

		Also note that unlike (cycling-link:), empty strings can be given. These instead create **separator elements**,
		which are rendered as unselectable horizontal lines that separate groups of options. Having empty strings as the first or
		last elements, however, will result in an error (as these can't meaningfully separate one group from another).

		The first element in a (dropdown:) will always be the one initially displayed and selected - and thus, the one that is
		immediately set into the bound variable.

		If you use (replace:) to alter the text inside a (dropdown:), such as `(dropdown: bind $tattoo, "Star", "Feather")(replace:"Star")[Claw]`,
		then the option text and the value assigned to the bound variable will change - but *only* when the player next interacts with the dropdown.
		$tattoo will be "Star" until a new option is selected, whereupon it will become either "Claw" or "Feather" depending on which was picked.

		Harlowe markup inside (dropdown:) labels will be ignored - the text will be treated as if the markup wasn't present. For instance,
		`(dropdown: bind $mode, "//Stealth//", "//Speed//")` will produce a dropdown with "Stealth" and "Speed", with the italic styling markup removed.

		(checkbox: Bind, String) -> Command

		A command that creates a checkbox input, which sets the given bound variable to `true` or `false`, depending on its state.

		Example usage:
		* `(checkbox: bind $gore, "Show violent scenes")` creates a checkbox labeled "Show violent scenes" which is initially unchecked.
		* `(checkbox: 2bind $perma, "Permadeath")` creates a checkbox which is initially checked if $perma is `true`, and continues to
		update itself whenever some other macros change $perma.

		Rationale:

		This command uses the common web page checkbox input to let you ask the player for their preference on an auxiliary or
		metatextual feature or decision. Unlike the (confirm:) command, this doesn't directly ask the player a yes/no question, but simply
		presents a phrase or option that they can opt into or out of. Thus, it is useful for offering choices that aren't directly "in-character"
		or diegetic in the narrative - though, you could still use it for that purpose if the clinical nature of a checkbox was especially fitting for the setting.

		Details:

		This macro accepts two-way binds using the `2bind` syntax. These will cause the checkbox's contents to always match the current value of the bound
		variable, and automatically update itself whenever any other macro changes it. However, if the variable no longer contains a boolean, then
		it won't update - for instance, if the variable becomes the number 23, the checkbox won't update.

		If the bound variable isn't two-way, the checkbox will be unchecked when it appears, and the variable will be set to `false` as soon as it is displayed.

		If the bound variable has already been given a type restriction (such as by `(set:num-type $candy to 1)`), then, if that type isn't `string` or
		`str`, an error will result.

		If the label string is empty, an error will result.

		(checkbox-fullscreen: String) -> Command

		A command that creates a checkbox input, which toggles the browser's fullscreen mode and windowed mode. The checkbox will automatically update to match
		the browser's fullscreen status. If fullscreen mode cannot be entered, the checkbox will be disabled.

		Example usage:
		`(checkbox-fullscreen: "Fullscreen mode")`

		Rationale:
		Modern browsers allow web pages to take up the entire screen of the user, in a manner similar to desktop games. This feature can be useful
		for immersive or moody stories, such as horror stories, that wish to immerse the player's senses in a certain colour or shade, or to display
		impactful text that doesn't have to compete for attention from any other screen elements. While it can be more convenient to place an (icon-fullscreen:)
		in your story's sidebar, this macro can be useful if you remove or replace the sidebar with something else, and can serve as an alternative
		means of activating fullscreen mode.

		Details:
		When activated, this will make the page's `<html>` element be the fullscreen element, *not* `<tw-story>`. This is because, in most browsers,
		removing the fullscreen element from the page, however briefly, will deactivate fullscreen mode. Since the `(enchant:)` macro, when given ?Page,
		will often need to wrap `<tw-story>` in another element, those macro calls will deactivate fullscreen mode if `<tw-story>` was the fullscreen element.
		So, if you have edited the compiled HTML to add elements before and after it, such as a navigation bar, that will remain visible while the story
		is in fullscreen mode. Additionally, this means that the Debug Mode panel is still visible when fullscreen mode is activated.
		
		Currently, there is no special functionality or error reporting when the browser reports that fullscreen mode is available, but the attempt
		to switch to fullscreen mode fails. In that case, the checkbox will simply appear to do nothing.

	/*d:
		(input: [Bind], [String], [String]) -> Command
	
		A command macro that creates a single-line text input element, allowing the player
		to input any amount of text without newlines, which can optionally be automatically stored in a variable.
		The first string specifies the horizontal position and width, and the second string specifies an initial default value to fill the element with.

		Example usage:
		* `(input: "Cheese Honey Sandwich")` produces an element that initially contains "Cheese Honey Sandwich", and which is 100% of the available width. Altering the contained text does nothing.
		* `(input: bind _name, "=X=", "Calder Faust")` produces an element that initially contains "Calder Faust", and which is 33% of the available width. Altering it automatically updates the _name temp variable.
		* `(input: bind _spell)` produces an element which is 100% of the available width, and with no initial default text inside it. Altering it automatically updates the _spell temp variable.

		Rationale:
		While there are other means of accepting player text input into the story, such as the (prompt:) macro, you may desire an input region
		that is integrated more naturally into the passage's visual design, and which allows a greater quantity of text to be inputted. This macro
		offers that functionality, and provides an easy means for that inputted text to be stored in a variable.

		Details:
		This macro has no mandatory values - `(input:)` by itself will produce a text input element with no bound variable, no placeholder and no default value.

		The optional sizing string is the same kind of line given to (box:) - a sequence of zero or more `=` signs, then a sequence of characters (preferably "X"), then zero or
		more `=` signs. Think of this string as a visual depiction of the element's horizontal proportions - the `=` signs are the space to
		the left and right, and the characters in the middle are the element itself. Also, to avoid ambiguity with the second string given to this macro,
		a string representing 100% width (no margins) must be a single character, such as just "X". If you need the initial contents of the element to be a single character,
		provide an "X" sizing string before it, so that it's clear which is which.

		The produced element always occupies an entire line of the containing area, as with (box:) and (button:). If you wish to place it alongside other text, consider using it inside the column markup.

		This macro accepts two-way binds using the `2bind` syntax. These will cause the element's contents to always match the current value of the bound
		variable, and automatically update itself whenever any other macro changes it. However, if the variable no longer contains a string, then
		it won't update - for instance, if the variable becomes the number 23, the element won't update.

		If the bound variable isn't two-way, the variable will be set to the element's contents as soon as it is displayed - so, it will become the optional
		initial text string, or, if it wasn't given, an empty string.

		If the bound variable has already been given a type restriction (such as by `(set:num-type $candy to 1)`), then, if that type isn't `string` or
		`str`, an error will result.

		The optional initial text string given to this macro will *not* be parsed as markup, but inserted into the element verbatim - so, giving
		`"''CURRENT SAVINGS'': $lifeSavings"` will not cause the $lifeSavings variable's contents to be printed into the element, nor will "CURRENT SAVINGS"
		be in boldface.

		A note about player-submitted strings: because most string-printing functionality in Harlowe (the (print:) macro, and putting variable names
		in bare passage prose) will attempt to render markup inside the strings, a player may cause disaster for your story by placing Harlowe markup
		inside an (input:) bound variable, which, when displayed, produces either an error or some effect that undermines the story. In order to
		display those strings safely, you may use either the verbatim markup, the (verbatim:) changer, or (verbatim-print:).

		As of 3.3.2, Harlowe will attempt to auto-focus input elements when they are added to the passage, allowing the player to
		type into them immediately. If multiple input elements are present, the first (highest) one will be auto-focused.
		Note that any further input elements added to the passage (via (after:) or some other means) will be auto-focused
		even if the player is currently typing into an existing element.

	/*d:
		(force-input: [Bind], [String], String) -> Command
	
		A command macro that creates a single-line text input element which appears to offer the player a means to input text,
		but instead replaces every keypress inside it with characters from a pre-set string that's relevant to the story.

		Example usage:
		* `(force-input: bind _cmd, "ERASE INTERNET")` creates an input element which forces the player to type the string "ERASE INTERNET", and binds the current
		contents of the element to the _cmd temp variable. If the player types four characters into it, _cmd will be the string "ERAS".

		Rationale:
		There are times when, for narrative reasons, you want the player, in the role of a character, to type text into a diegetic textbox, or make
		a seemingly "spontaneous" dialogue reply, but are unable to actually permit the player to type anything they want, as the story you're telling calls for
		specific dialogue or text at this point. While you could simply offer a "pretend" textbox using the (box:) macro, that can't actually be typed into, this
		macro offers an interesting and unexpected alternative: a text element that tricks the player into thinking they can type anything, only to change the text to fit
		your narrative letter-by-letter as they type it.

		This interface element has very potent and unsettling symbolism - the player suddenly being unable to trust their own keyboard to relay their words gives a
		strong feeling of unreality and loss of control, and as such, it is advised that, unless you wish to leverage that symbolism for horror purposes, you
		should perhaps prepare the player for this element's eccentricity with some accompanying text. Besides that, giving the player the tactile sense of typing words
		can help them occupy the role of their viewpoint character in situations where it's called for, such as a story revolving around text messaging or chat clients.

		Details:
		Unlike (input:), the final string is mandatory, as it holds the text that the input element will contain as the player "types" it in.

		The optional sizing string is the same kind of line given to (box:) - a sequence of zero or more `=` signs, then a sequence of characters (preferably "X"), then zero or
		more `=` signs. Think of this string as a visual depiction of the box's horizontal proportions - the `=` signs are the space to
		the left and right, and the characters in the middle are the box itself. Also, to avoid ambiguity with the second string given to this macro,
		a string representing 100% width (no margins) must be a single character, such as just "X". If you need the initial contents of the element to be a single character,
		provide an "X" sizing string before it, so that it's clear which is which.

		The produced element always occupies an entire line of the containing area, as with (box:) and (button:). If you wish to place it alongside other text, consider using it inside the column markup.

		Because you already know what the text in the element will become, you may feel there's no need to have a bound variable. However, you might wish to bind a temporary
		variable, and then check using a live macro when that variable has become filled with the full string, thus indicating that the player has read it. Otherwise,
		there is no mechanism to ensure that the player actually type out the entire string.

		If the bound variable is two-way, and it contains a string, then, when the input box appears, a number of fixed text characters equal to the string's length will be
		inserted into the input element automatically, and then the variable will update to match. Otherwise, if the bound variable is one-way, the variable will simply
		become an empty string (and then be updated to match the element's contents whenever the player "types" into it).

		As of 3.3.2, Harlowe will attempt to auto-focus input elements when they are added to the passage, allowing the player to

		(input-box: [Bind], [String], [Number], [String]) -> Command

		A command macro that creates a multi-line text input box of the given position, width (specified by the first, optional string) and height (specified by
		the optional number), allowing the player to input any amount of text, which can optionally be automatically stored in a variable.
		The final optional string specifies an initial default value to fill the box with.

		Example usage:
		* `(input-box: "=X=")` creates an input box that's 33% of the passage width, centered, and 3 lines tall.
		* `(input-box: "XXX=", 5)` creates an input box that's 75% of the passage width, positioned left, and 5 lines tall.
		* `(input-box: bind $code, "XXX=", 5)` creates an input box that's the same as above, but whenever it's edited, the text is stored
		in the $code variable.
		* `(input-box: bind $code, "XXX=", 5, "10 PRINT 'HELLO'")` creates an input box that's the same as above, but initially contains
		the text `"10 PRINT 'HELLO'"`.

		Rationale:
		This macro forms a pair with (input:). This is a variation of that macro which allows multi-line text to be inputted. While the former
		macro is best used for obtaining short, informative strings from the player, this macro can be used to obtain entire sentences or
		paragraphs, which may be desirable if the story is themed around writing.

		Details:
		The optional sizing string is the same kind of line given to (box:) - a sequence of zero or more `=` signs, then a sequence of characters (preferably "X"), then zero or
		more `=` signs. Think of this string as a visual depiction of the box's horizontal proportions - the `=` signs are the space to
		the left and right, and the characters in the middle are the box itself. Also, to avoid ambiguity with the second string given to this macro,

		provide an "X" sizing string before it, so that it's clear which is which.

		The produced element always occupies an entire line of the containing area, as with (box:) and (button:). If you wish to place it alongside other text, consider using it inside the column markup.

		The optional number, which must come directly after the sizing line, is a height, in text lines. If this is absent, the box will be sized to 3
		lines. Harlowe's default CSS applies `resize:none` to the box, preventing it (in most browsers) from being resizable by the player.

		This macro accepts two-way binds using the `2bind` syntax. These will cause the box's contents to always match the current value of the bound
		variable, and automatically update itself whenever any other macro changes it. However, if the variable no longer contains a string, then
		it won't update - for instance, if the variable becomes the number 23, the box won't update.

		If the bound variable isn't two-way, the variable will be set to the box's contents as soon as it is displayed - so, it will become the optional
		initial text string, or, if it wasn't given, an empty string.

		If the bound variable has already been given a type restriction (such as by `(set:num-type $candy to 1)`), then, if that type isn't `string` or

		Rationale:

	/*d:
		(show: ...HookName) -> Command

		Reveals hidden hooks, running the code within if it's not been shown yet.

		Example usage:
		```
		|fan)[The overhead fan spins lazily.]
		
		(link:"Turn on fan")[(t8n:"dissolve")(show:?fan)]
		```

		Rationale:
		The purpose of hidden hooks is, of course, to eventually show them - and this macro is
		how you show them. You can use this command inside a (link:), trigger it in real-time with
		a (live:) macro, or anywhere else. You can also re-reveal a hook that had been hidden with (hide:), but
		any macros in that hook won't be re-run.

		<h4>Using (show:) vs (replace:):</h4>

		There are different reasons for using hidden hooks and (show:) instead of (replace:). For your stories,
		think about whether the prose being revealed is part of the "main" text of the passage, or is just an aside.
		In neatly-coded stories, the main text should appear early in a passage's code, as the focus of the
		writer's attention.

		When using (replace:), the replacement prose is written far from its insertion point. This can improve
		readability when the insertion point is part of a long paragraph or sentence, and the prose is a minor aside
		or amendment, similar to a footnote or post-script, that would clutter the paragraph were it included inside.
		Additionally, (replace:) can be used in a "header" or "footer" tagged passage to affect certain named hooks
		throughout the story.

		```
		You turn away from her, facing the grandfather clock, its [stern ticking]<1| filling the tense silence.

		(click-replace: ?1)[echoing, hollow ticking]
		```

		When using (show:), the hidden hook's position is fixed in the passage prose. This can improve
		readability when the hidden hook contains a lot of the "main" text of a passage, which provides vital context
		and meaning for the rest of the text.

		```
		I don't know where to begin... |1)[The weird state of my birth, the prophecy made centuries ago,
		my first day of school, the day of the meteors, the day I awoke my friends' powers... so many strands in
		the tapestry of my tale, and no time to unravel them.] ...so for now I'll start with when we fell down the hole.

		(link:"Where, indeed?")[(show:?1)]
		```

		But, there aren't any hard rules for when you should use one or the other. As a passage changes in the writing, you should
		feel free to change between one or the other, or leave your choice as-is.

		Details:
		(show:) will reveal every hook with the given name. To only reveal a specific hook, you can use the
		possessive syntax, as usual: `(show: ?shrub's 1st)`.

		You can attach a transition changer, such as (transition:), (transition-time:), (transition-delay:), and the rest, to this command.
		Doing so will cause that transition to be applied to the hook.

		Much like (replace:), (show:) cannot affects hooks or text that haven't been printed yet - if the (show:)
		runs at the same time that the passage is appearing (as in, it isn't inside a hook that's delayed by (live:), (link:), (event:)
		or similar macros), and a hook or line of text appears after it in the passage, the macro won't replace its contents
		even if it's a valid target. For example: `(show:?fence)|fence)[A white picket fence.]` won't work because the (show:) runs immediately.

		If you provide to (show:) a hook which is already visible, nothing will happen - no error will be produced. If you provide to
		(show:) a hook that had been visible, but was hidden with (hide:), then the hook will reappear, but its macros won't be re-run.
		If you wish to re-run an already visible hook, use (rerun:). Note that hooks whose visible contents have been replaced with
		nothing, such as via `(replace: ?1)[]`, are still considered "visible".

		If you give ?page to (show:), an error will result - the entire page can't ever be "hidden".

		If you wish to reveal a hook after a number of other links have been clicked and removed, such as those created
		by (link-reveal:) or (click:), you may find the (more:) macro to be convenient.

		(hidden:), (replace:), (rerun:), (more:), (animate:)

		#showing and hiding
	*/
	/*d:
		(rerun: ...HookName) -> Command
		
		Reruns hooks, restoring them to their original contents, and running the macros within them an additional time.

		Example usage:
		```
		|1>[You drew a (either:...(range:2,10), "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace") of (either:"Hearts","Clubs","Spades","Diamonds").]
		(link-rerun:"Shuffle and draw.")[(t8n:"dissolve")(rerun:?1)]
		```

		Rationale:
		You may often use macros like (replace:) or (append:) to alter the contents of hooks in your passages. But, you may also want an
		easy way of reversing these changes, to restore the hook to its original state as it had been written in your passage's code.
		This macro provides a means of doing so without having to reload or revisit the entire passage.

		In addition to re-running hooks elsewhere in the passage, you can produce some useful effects by having a (rerun:) affect its containing hook:
		```
		|1>[You're nude in the changing room, with only your reflection for company.
		(link:"Dress up")[You dress yourself up. Regrettably, you both look worse. (link:"Take off clothes")[(rerun:?1)]]]
		```

		Furthermore, as (rerun:) causes macros in the hook to re-run themselves, it can be used to "update" hooks to match the present game state:
		```
		(set:$energy to 100)
		|1>[Shields: $energy % (text-color:red)[( - $dmg %)]]
		(link-rerun: "Take the punch")[(set:$dmg to (either:1,2,3), $energy to it - $dmg)You get punched square in the cockpit!(rerun: ?1)]
		```

		Details:
		(rerun:) will use the hook's original source *as it was written* in the passage source - any alterations done to it using (replace:) and other
		such macros will not be considered.

		(rerun:) will re-run every hook with the given name. To only re-run a specific hook, you can use the
		possessive syntax, as usual: `(rerun: ?daydream's 1st)`.

		You can attach a transition changer, such as (transition:), (transition-time:), (transition-delay:), and the rest, to this command.
		Doing so will cause that transition to be applied to the hook.

		(rerun:), unlike (show:), will not work on hidden hooks until they become visible using (show:) or (link-show:).

		If you give ?page to (rerun:), an error will result. If you wish to "rerun" the entire page, consider using (restart:).

		If you give ?passage to (rerun:), the entire passage's code will be re-rendered. This will *not* change the value of the `visits`
		keyword, or count as an additional turn in any way.

		If you want to rerun a hook multiple times based on elapsed real time, use the (live:) macro.

			Rationale:
			There are times when you need to remove a hook from visibility, but don't want its contents to be forgotten or re-run,

			If you want to remove the hook's contents all together, and re-create it anew later, consider using (replace:) and (rerun:)

		/*d:
			(scroll: HookName, Number or HookName) -> Command

			This command, when given a HookName, followed by a fraction (a number between 0 and 1), will change the scroll position of every hook with that name
			to the percentage of their height signified by the fraction. You may alternatively give another HookName instead,
			which, if a hook of that name is inside the first hook, will scroll the first hook and each containing hook such that the second
			hook is visible.

			Example usage:
			* `(scroll:?page, 1)` will scroll the entire page to the bottom.
			* `(scroll:?page, 0.5)` will scroll the entire page to the middle.
			* `(scroll:?page, ?danger)` will scroll the entire page such that the first hook named ?danger is visible.
			* `(scroll:?A, ?C)` will change the scroll position of hooks named ?A such that hooks named ?C are visible. Note that if
			the hook named ?A is itself not visible (because it's offscreen) then the page's scroll position will not change to make it
			visible.

			Rationale:
			When you're using a large number of prose-altering macros in your story, such as (replace:) or (show:), you'll often want to make
			sure the player can see the changed text immediately. This may be complicated by the fact that they could be playing the story on a small
			screen. The (scroll:) command lets you force the page to be in a particular scroll position whenever you want, ensuring that the affected
			prose is visible.

			Alternatively, when using scrollable boxes like (box:), you may want to change their initial scroll position from the default (the top),
			for any number of reasons.

			Details:
			This command only changes the Y (vertical) scroll position of the given hooks.

			This command does nothing if no hooks of the given name exist in the passage, or if none of them have vertical scroll bars. Also,
			it does nothing if the second HookName doesn't correspond to any hooks inside the first hook.

			Obviously, giving a non-fractional number will cause an error.

			Due to browser limitations, giving a fractional number will *not* work in Internet Explorer 10. If you wish for your story to support that browser,
			please give a second HookName instead of a percentage.

			(load-game: String) -> Command

			Example usage:
			```
			{(if: (saved-games: ) contains "Slot A")[
			  (link: "Load game")[(load-game:"Slot A")]
			]}
			```
			
			Details:
			Just as (save-game:) exists to store the current game session, (load-game:) exists to retrieve a past
			game session, whenever you want. This command, when given the string name of a slot, will attempt to
			load the save, completely and instantly replacing the variables and move history with that of the
			save, and going to the passage where that save was made.
			
			This macro assumes that the save slot exists and contains a game, which you can check by seeing if
			`(saved-games: ) contains` the slot name before running (load-game:).

			This command can't have changers attached - attempting to do so will produce an error.

			To avoid a potential infinite loop, whereby (load-game:) loads a game whose current passage contains
			another (load-game:) call, an error will occur if (load-game:) is run immediately after a game is loaded.
			("Immediately" means that the second (load-game:) call occurs with no time delay, such as by (after:), or with
			no player input, such as by (link:).)

			In the event that the saved data exists, but contains an error - for instance, if it refers to a passage
			which doesn't exist in this story, which could happen if one version of the story is used to save it, and
			another is used to open it - then a polite dialog box will appear asking the reader whether or not the data
			should be deleted. An example of such a dialog is below.
			<blockquote>
			Sorry to interrupt... The story tried to load saved data, but there was a problem.
			The data refers to a passage named 'example', but it isn't in this story.<br><br>
			That data might have been saved from a different version of this story. Should I delete it?<br>

			(forget-undos: Number) -> Command

			This macro, when used, "forgets" previous turns, preventing the player from using undo features (like (link-undo:))
			to return to them. Providing a positive number will forget that many turns from the start of the game, and providing a
			negative number will forget all the turns up to that point from the end.

			Example usage:
			* `(forget-undos:-2)` forgets all previous turns up to and including the second-last turn.
			* `(forget-undos:-1)` forgets all previous turns.
			* `(forget-undos:1)` forgets the first turn. This could be useful for erasing a "title screen" turn
			from the game session, which doesn't make sense for the player to "undo".

			Rationale:
			By default, Harlowe allows the player (via the default sidebar) to undo any number of turns, all the way up to
			the start of the game. This macro makes it easy to limit this ability, either at key moments in the story (such as
			the starts of chapters or viewpoint switches) or constantly, by placing it in a "header" or "footer" tagged passage.

			Note that while it's possible to limit the player's ability to undo by simply removing or replacing the default (icon-undo:)
			instance from the sidebar (such as, for example, `(replace:?sidebar)[(if:$canUndo)(icon-undo: )]`, and then conditionally changing the $canUndo variable
			throughout the story), this macro provides a more direct way of limiting undos. In particular, it makes it
			easy to limit the *distance* that a player can undo from the current turn.

			It is recommended that you be careful in your use of this macro. In most cases, limiting the player's ability to undo actions isn't
			a particularly interesting or clever game design restriction. However, there are certain genres of game, such as
			survival horror games or experiential dream simulators, where suddenly limiting the ability to undo at periodic intervals
			can have a desirable disempowering effect.

			There is one other situation where (forget-undos:) may be of use: when you're writing an "endless" story, one that will be played over an indefinite
			number of turns, such as a kiosk or an art installation. Because Harlowe constantly maintains an undo cache, then over many thousands of turns,
			the ever-increasing memory usage of the story may become detrimental to the browser's performance. Periodically using (forget-undos:) and (forget-visits:)
			(in a "header" or "footer" tagged passage, for instance) to erase data from hundreds of turns ago (such as by `(forget-visits:-200)(forget-undos:-200)`
			will keep the undo cache (and the record of visited passages) from growing beyond a certain point, preventing this situation from occurring.

			Details:
			This macro does nothing if it is run in a passage that has been returned to by "undo" (i.e. where there is one or more turns
			one could "redo" using (icon-redo:)). It only functions in the "present".

			If there aren't enough past turns to forget (for instance, when `(forget-undos:4)` is run when only two turns have been taken) then
			all past turns will be forgotten.

			There is no way to "un-erase" the forgotten turns when this macro is used. Its effects are permanent.

			Use of this macro will *not* affect the (history:) macro, the (visited:) macro, or the `visits` and `turns` keywords (nor
			the debug-only (mock-visits:) and (mock-turns:) macros). These will continue to perform as if (forget-undos:) was never called.
			However, the turns that they refer to (in which the "visits" occurred) will no longer be accessible to the player. If you wish
			to affect the (history:) macro and the like, consider using (forget-visits:).

			This macro will internally "flatten" every forgotten turn into a single data structure, which is used to ensure that
			(history:) and (visited:) and other such features continue to behave as expected.
			As a result, using this macro will reduce the size of the data saved to browser localStorage by (save-game:). However, you should
			*not* use this macro solely on the hunch that it provides performance benefits for your story - such benefits only
			come to stories that take place over a very large number of turns, and who store a large amount of data in global
			variables (such as expansive datamaps and arrays that are changed frequently).

			If 0 is given, no past turns will be forgotten.

		/*d:
			(forget-visits: Number) -> Command

			This macro "forgets" all visits that occurred before the given turn number - any passage visits that occurred on those turns are treated as if they didn't happen.
			This causes (history:) to no longer list those passages at the start of the array, the `visits` identifier to report a different number for those passages, and
			(if the only visit to a passage was erased) the (visited:) macro to no longer regard a passage as visited.

			Example usage:
			* `(forget-visits: -10)` causes all visits more than 10 turns old (that is, the 10thlast turn) to expire.
			* `(forget-visits: -1)` forgets all visits prior to this turn.

			Rationale:
			This macro forms a pair with (forget-undos:). These together allow you to erase two kinds of non-variable data tracked by Harlowe - the undo cache, and
			the record of passage visits.

			The `visits` identifier and the (history:) macro are not intended to be "special variables" that the author can permute as they may wish - they have a very specific meaning
			within Harlowe's language. Using them as they are designed (as permanent records of when the player visited a passage or passages) is highly recommended. This is why
			this macro only offers limited functionality for erasing visits.

			That being said, there are a few edge-case situations when you'd want to use (forget-visits:). If your story consists entirely of "sub-stories" (like an anthology) that individually use `visits`,
			but which also need to be revisitable/replayable without restarting the whole story with (restart:), then this (along with (forget-undos:)) can be used to erase all of the visits
			once the player has finished a sub-story, so that (along with resetting its variables using (set:)) it can be replayed as it was.

			The other situation is when you're writing an "endless" story, one that will be played over an indefinite number of turns, such as a kiosk or an art installation. Because
			Harlowe is constantly recording visited passages (as part of the (history:) macro's functionality) then over many thousands of turns, the ever-increasing memory usage of the story may become
			detrimental to the browser's performance. Periodically running both (forget-undos:) and (forget-visits:) (in a "header" or "footer" tagged passage, for instance) to erase data from
			hundreds of turns ago (such as by `(forget-visits:-200)(forget-undos:-200)` will keep the record of visited passages (and the undo cache) from growing beyond a certain point,
			preventing this situation from occurring.

			Details:
			You currently cannot use this macro to erase "mock visits" created with (mock-visits:).

			The effects of (forget-visits:) can be undone by the player using (link-undo:), the sidebar undo button, and so forth, so previous turns are unaffected
			by this command. This also means that the visits still "exist" as long as you can undo past the turn in which (forget-visits:) was used.

			If there aren't enough past turns' visits to erase (for instance, when `(forget-visits:4)` is run when only two turns have been taken) then
			all past visits will be erased.

			If 0 is given, no past turns will be erased.

			Because of the very specific purposes this macro is designed for, there is *no* way to forget visits of just a single passage, or after a certain turn, or in other, more specific ways.
			If you really need to manipulate a passage's recorded visits like this, please use a variable to track "visits" to this passage instead.

			(mock-visits: ...String) -> Command

			A macro that can only be used in debug mode, this allows you to mark various passages as "visited", even though the player
			actually hasn't. This allows you to quickly test passages that use the `visits` keyword, or the `(history:)` datamap, without
			having to play through the whole game from the start.

			Example usage:
			* `(mock-visits:"Juice Temple", "Milk Temple", "Water Temple")` marks the passages "Juice Temple", "Milk Temple" and "Water Temple" as each having been visited once.
			* `(mock-visits:"Lobby","Lobby","Lobby")` marks the "Lobby" passage as having been visited 3 times.

			Rationale:
			Using the `visits` keyword, or the (history:) array, as a way to track the player's progress instead of using Boolean variables and (set:)
			can produce simpler, more understandable code - it's obvious what `(if: visits is > 2)` means just by looking at it. But, it comes
			with a cost: when testing your story using the "Play from here" feature in the Twine editor, you may want to pretend that you have visited the
			requisite passages a given number of times, so as to examine the resulting prose. If you were using variables, you could add a few temporary
			(set:) macros to the passage, or put them in a "debug-header" tagged passage, to adjust the variables to match a game in progress. This macro
			provides that same functionality to the `visits` keyword and (history:) array, letting you temporarily adjust it for testing purposes.

			Details:
			It's critical to understand that these are **mock** visits - the passages listed are not actually visited, and code inside them is not run by this macro.

			As stated above, this macro will cause an error if it's used outside debug mode. This is NOT intended for use in a final game - while temporarily
			tweaking the meaning of `visits` and (history:) is convenient for testing, the author should be able to trust that in the "real" game, they
			correctly report the visits the player has actually made, so that the story's code can be properly understood.

			Each occurrence of a passage name given to this macro counts as a single mock visit. Add multiples of the same passage name to register multiple mock
			visits to that passage.

			If this macro is used multiple times, only the final usage will count - all the rest will be forgotten. `(mock-visits:"A")(mock-visits:"B")`, for instance,
			will only cause the "B" passage to be considered visited 1 time. This allows you to remove mock visits in the middle of a story by writing `(mock-visits:)`.

			The effects of (mock-visits:) are saved by (save-game:) as of version 3.2.3.

			If you undo past a passage that used (mock-visits:), the effects of that macro call will be removed, as if it had been a (set:) macro call.

		/*d:
			(seed: String) -> Command

			A command that "fixes" Harlowe's random number generator, causing all random macros and features to output
			predetermined values based on the given "seed" string.

			Example usage:
			`(seed:"aeiouy")(random:1,10) (random:1,10) (random:1,10)` will print `3 2 6`.

			Rationale:
			One of the appeals of randomness in games is its unpredictability, but one of the detriments of it is its
			irreplicability. Once a series of random values has been rolled, it's usually not possible to replicate that
			streak of luck. This can be bothersome if, for instance, you want to give an unpredictable challenge to players,
			but don't want any one player to arbitrarily get an easier or harder challenge than another.

			This macro gives you the ability to control the randomness of your story. Harlowe (like most computer games)
			uses a "pseudo" random number generator (pseudo RNG, or PRNG) to make random choices. (It is "pseudo" because
			truly random numbers cannot be generated by a computer, and can only be found by sampling external physical phenomena.)

			Think of the PRNG as a "vine" of numbers, that "grow" from a single "seed" (a special modifier value). Each random
			feature in your story (like a single (either:) call) takes a number from the sequence and uses it to make a choice
			(like picking one of the (either:) values). So, as long as the seed is the same, the same values will be "grown",
			and if the player encounters random features in the same order, the same values will be taken.

			You may want to use (seed:) for these purposes:
			* Seed it based on a player name (inputted via (input-box:) or (prompt:)) to assign a unique challenge to each
			player that can
			* Seed it based on the current date (using (current-date:)) to produce a "daily challenge" that will be the same
			for all players (provided their system clock is set to the current date).

			Details:
			The oft-mentioned "random features" are the (random:), (either:) and (shuffled:) macros, as well as the `random`
			data names (invoked using `'s random` or `random of`).

			Even though I've called the seed a "special modifier value", this macro actually takes a string. This is so
			that the aforementioned uses (such as using (current-date:)) are simple, and also so that you may
			provide (seed:) with easy-to-remember words like "apple", if you so wish. The string is internally converted
			to a number using a complicated procedure that ensures similar strings (like "app" and "appl") still grow
			very different sequences of random numbers. So, don't be concerned with using too-similar strings as seed values.

			Harlowe's random number generator is initially, automatically seeded based on the timestamp at which the game begins
			so you do *not* need to call this at all to get unpredictable randomness that isn't replicated
			across playthroughs. You should use this *only* to control your story's randomness, not create it.
			(restart:) will reset the seed using this method.

			The current seed (and the number of values currently taken) is saved when you use (save-game:), so loading a saved game will continue
			to use the same sequence of random values that were in use when the game was saved.

			(seed:) is best used at the very beginning of the story, or at least before the first random feature is used. Using it
			in the middle of the story will cause the randomness to use a different seed, and should generally only be used when
			you wish the player to replay a section of the story with different random values.

			Giving the same string to (seed:) will reset the number of values taken. So, if `(seed:"A")` followed by five `(random:1,10)`
			calls produced 4,2,8,4 and 9 in that order, then calling `(seed:"A")` again will cause the next five `(random:1,10)`
			calls to produce 4,2,8,4 and 9 in that order.

			Using (seed:) multiple times will not affect the "randomness" of the numbers produced - they will be
			similarly "random" and unpredictable.

			For reference, Harlowe's random number generator is [mulberry32](https://gist.github.com/tommyettinger/46a874533244883189143505d203312c) by Tommy Ettinger, and the seed is hashed
			with [MurmurHash3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) by Austin Appleby. It is not expected that Harlowe stories will use random elements at a frequency
			expected of action games (which use RNG up to hundreds of times per frame), and therefore a 32-bit algorithm should be sufficient.

			(dialog: [Bind], String or CodeHook, ...String) -> Command
			Also known as: (alert:)

			A command that, when used, displays a pop-up dialog box with the given string or codehook displayed, and a number of button-shaped links labeled with
			the remaining other strings. If an optional bound variable is provided, that variable is updated to match the pressed button.

			Example usage:
			* `(dialog: [Beyond this point, things get serious. Grab a snack and buckle up.], "Sure.")`
			* `(dialog: bind $defund, "Which department will you defund?", "Law Enforcement", "Education", "Health", "Public Housing")`

			Rationale:
			It may seem counterintuitive for such a heavily text-based medium as a hypertext story to have a need for dialog boxes, but they can serve as
			places to include auxiliary text that's contextually separate from the passage's themes, such as brief updates on characters, tasks and goals, or
			momentary asides on incidental world details. because they darken and cover the screen when they appear, they are also very useful for
			displaying and offering especially climactic actions or decisions, such as an irreversible ethical choice.

			While there are other dialog box-producing macros, namely (prompt:) and (confirm:), those are meant purely for input-gathering purposes.
			This is designed to be the most general-use dialog-producing macro, allowing any number of links, and optionally binding the clicked link to a variable.

			Details:
			There's no difference in behaviour when you provide this with a codehook instead of a string. That being said, codehooks are recommended because
			their internal markup is correctly coloured in the Twine editor, and because `"` or `'` symbols don't need to be escaped (using `\`) inside them.

			The dialog that is produced is implemented entirely in HTML. User CSS stylesheets can be used to style it, and (enchant:) macros that affect ?Link can
			affect the dialog links.

			In Harlowe versions prior to 3.1.0, this macro used the built-in `alert()` function of the browser, but to
			support certain newer browsers that no longer offer this function, the macro was changed.

			If no button strings are given, a single link reading "OK" will be used. Giving empty strings for any of the links will cause an error.

			When the dialog is on-screen, the entire game is essentially "paused" - until it is dismissed,
			no further computations are performed, links can't be clicked (except links inside the dialog text itself),
			(click:) enchantments shouldn't work, and (live:) and (event:) macros
			shouldn't fire.

			For obvious reasons, you cannot supply a two-way bound variable to this macro. Doing so will cause an error to result.

			From version 3.2.0 on, it is possible to attach changers to this command. `(t8n:'slide-up')+(text-rotate-x:25)(dialog:"EMAIL SENT!")`, for instance, produces a dialog
			that's tilted upward, and which slides upward when it appears.

			(enchant:) or (hide:). These commands can have a large and cumbersome set of data given to them, and removing and adding them
			can be bothersome. The (ignore:) macro can be of assistance here: simply change the command's name to "ignore", and it will
			do nothing, while NOT causing an error regardless of what sort of data is given to it. Then, you can quickly change it back
			to the original name after testing.

			Details:
			While it will ignore all well-formed data given to it, (ignore:) will NOT suppress errors that are already present in the data.
			For instance, `(ignore: 4 + "2")` will still cause an error.

			This command can have changers attached, but will, of course, ignore them.

			(test-true:), (test-false:)

		/*d:
			(assert-exists: HookName or String) -> Command

			A debugging macro that confirms whether a hook with the given name, or passage text matching the given string, is present in the passage.
			If not, it will produce a helpful error. Use this to test whether enchantment macros like (click:), (enchant:) or (show:) are working properly.

			Example usage:
			* `(assert-exists: "the auroch")` will produce an error if the text "the auroch" isn't present in the passage.
			* `(assert-exists: ?bottomBar)` will produce an error if a ?bottomBar hook isn't present in the passage.

			Rationale:
			The macros in Harlowe that remotely affect other hooks or text based on their name or contents, such as (click:), are designed such that they
			do not cause an error if no matching hooks or text is found in the passage. This allows them to be thought of as similar to CSS rules for how passage prose
			is to be rendered - something like `(enchant:?dust, (text-style:'blur'))` states the "rule" that ?dust hooks are to be blurred - rather than as imperative commands
			that must be fulfilled there and then. This means that they can be placed in every passage, via "header" or "footer" tagged passages, without errors occurring.
			But, this flexibility comes at a cost. In the minority of situations where you need to be certain that a macro is affecting a visible in-passage
			structure, you'll often want to test with this macro, so as to produce an error if those structures do not exist.

			Details:
			This command (and note that (assert:) doesn't produce a command) probes the current passage in which it's located in order to determine whether to produce an error or not.
			As such, like all commands, it can be saved into a variable, and deployed into passage code using that variable, to save having to retype it in full.

			If you provide an empty string to this macro (which obviously can't be found in the passage), it will produce a different kind of error than what would be desired.

		/*d:
			(assert: Boolean) -> Instant

			A debugging macro that produces a helpful error whenever the expression given to it produces Boolean false. Use this when testing your story
			to help ensure that certain facts about the game state are true or not.

			Example usage:
			`(assert: $isWounded is $isBleeding or $isBandaged)` ensures that if $isWounded is true, one of $isBleeding or $isBandaged MUST be true, and if it's false,
			both of them MUST be false. Otherwise, an error is produced.

			Rationale:
			Harlowe's debug mode provides panels to check the current game state, the contents of variables, active enchantments, and so forth, providing assistance
			in identifying bugs. Of course, knowing what variables contain is not the same as knowing whether the relationships between them are being maintained, and
			a way of encoding these relationships, in your story, can provide an additional layer of security when debugging your game. 

			(assert:) allows you to *assert* facts about the game state, facts which absolutely must be true, so much so that
			an error should be produced. For example, if your story's code assumes that the variable $nails will always be smaller than or equal to $maxNails, and you want to
			ensure that no bugs are written that cause $nails to be greater, you may write `(assert: $nails is <= $maxNails)`, and place that call in
			a "debug-header" tagged passage. Thus, should a bug ever appear which causes these variables to no longer maintain their relationship, the (assert:) call will produce an error.

			Details:
			Note that there are other tools within Harlowe to ensure that variables are obeying certain restrictions, which make the need for certain simple (assert:) calls
			unnecessary. Chief among these features is TypedVars, which can be provided to (set:) to permanently and automatically restrict a certain variable to a narrow range
			of data. Instead of writing `(assert: $petals is an int)`, you can change the earliest (set:) call that creates $petals to `(set: int-type $petals to 0)`.

			Though this is classed as a "debugging" macro, this works even outside of debug mode.

			This can also be useful within custom macros, as a shortened form of combining (if:) with (error:). However, the error message produced by (assert:) may not
			be as insightful as the customisable error message given to (error:), so it's not especially recommended for use within custom macros that are meant for other authors
			to use.

		/*d:
			(save-game: String, [String]) -> Boolean
			
			This macro saves the current game's state in browser storage, in the given save slot,
			and including a special filename. It can then be restored using (load-game:).
			
			Example usage:
			```
			##Chapter 2: The Mortuary
			(save-game:"Slot A","Chapter 2 start")
			```

			Rationale:
			
			Many web games use browser cookies to save the player's place in the game.
			Harlowe allows you to save the game, including all of the variables that were (set:)
			or (put:), and the passages the player visited, to the player's browser storage.
			
			(save-game:) is a single operation that can be used as often or as little as you
			want to. You can include it on every page; You can put it at the start of each "chapter";
			You can put it inside a (link:) hook, such as
			```
			{(link:"Save game")[
			  (if:(save-game:"Slot A"))[
			    Game saved!
			  ](else: )[
			    Sorry, I couldn't save your game.
			  ]
			]}
			```
			and let the player choose when to save.
			
			Details:
			
			(save-game:)'s first string is a slot name in which to store the game. You can have as many slots
			as you like. If you only need one slot, you can just call it, say, `"A"`, and use `(save-game:"A")`.
			You can tie them to a name the player gives, such as `(save-game: $playerName)`, if multiple players
			are likely to play this game - at an exhibition, for instance.
			
			Giving the saved game a file name is optional, but allows that name to be displayed by finding it in the
			(saved-games:) datamap. This can be combined with a (load-game:)(link:) to clue the players into the save's contents:
			```
			(link: "Load game: " + ("Slot 1") of (saved-games: ))[
			  (load-game: "Slot 1")
			]
			```
			
			(save-game:) evaluates to a boolean - true if the game was indeed saved, and false if the browser prevented
			it (because they're using private browsing, their browser's storage is full, or some other reason).
			Since there's always a possibility of a save failing, you should use (if:) and (else:) with (save-game:)
			to display an apology message in the event that it returns false (as seen above).

			Using the (forget-undos:) macro will, as a side effect of its turn-erasing functionality, reduce the size of the data saved
			to browser localStorage by (save-game:). However, you should *not* use that macro solely on the hunch that it provides
			performance benefits for your story. See the (forget-undos:) macro's article for slightly more details.

			(prompt: String or CodeHook, String, [String], [String]) -> String

			When this macro is evaluated, a browser pop-up dialog box is shown with the first string displayed,
			a text entry box containing the second string (as a default value), a confirm link and a cancel link.
			If the confirm link is clicked, it evaluates to the string in the text entry box. If "Cancel" is clicked, it evaluates to
			the default value regardless of the entry box's contents.

			Example usage:
			`(set: $name to (prompt: [Your name, please:], "Frances Spayne", "Don't care", "Confirm"))`

			Details:
			The dialog that is produced is implemented entirely in HTML. User CSS stylesheets can be used to
			style it, and (enchant:) macros that affect ?Link can affect the dialog links.

			The order of the two optional strings is: the cancel link text, followed by the confirm link text. If
			one or neither of these is provided, the defaults for each are "Cancel" and "OK". Giving a blank string
			for the cancel link will cause that link to disappear. Giving an empty string for the confirm link will
			cause an error (because that link must be clickable for the dialog to work).

			In Harlowe versions prior to 3.1.0, this macro used the built-in `prompt()` function of the browser, but to
			support certain newer browsers that no longer offer this function, the macro was changed.

			When the dialog is on-screen, the entire game is essentially "paused" - until it is dismissed,

			A note about player-submitted strings: because most string-printing functionality in Harlowe (the (print:) macro,
			and putting variable names in bare passage prose) will attempt to render markup inside the strings, a player
			may cause disaster for your story by placing Harlowe markup inside a (prompt:) string, which, when displayed,
			produces either an error or some effect that undermines the story. In order to display those strings
			safely, you may use either the verbatim markup, the (verbatim:) changer, or (verbatim-print:).
