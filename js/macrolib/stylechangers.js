		Changer data
		
		Changers are similar to commands, but they only have an effect when they're attached to hooks,
		passage links and commands, and modify them in some manner. Macros that work like this include (text-style:), (font:),
		(t8n:), (text-rotate:), (hook:), (click:), (link:), (for:), (if:), and more.

		```
		(set: $sawDuckHarbinger to true)
		(if: $sawDuckHarbinger)[You still remember spying the black duck, harbinger of doom.]
		(t8n-depart: "dissolve")[[Return to the present]]
		```

		You can save changers into variables, and re-use them many times in your story:
		```
		(set: $robotic to (font:'Courier New'))
		$robotic[Hi, it's me. Your clanky, cold friend.]
		```
		Alternatively, you may prefer to use the (change:) or (enchant:) macro to accomplish the same thing using only hook names:
		```
		|robotic>[Hi, it's me. Your clanky, cold friend.]
		(change: ?robotic, (font:'Courier New'))
		```
		Changers can be combined using the `+` operator: `(text-colour: red) + (font: "Courier New")[This text is red Courier New.]`
		styles the text using both changers at once. These combined changers, too, can be saved in variables or used with (change:)
		or (enchant:).
		```
		(set: _alertText to (font:"Courier New") + (text-style: "buoy")+(text-colour:"#e74"))

		/*d:
			(if: Boolean) -> Changer
			
			This macro accepts only booleans (variables with `true` or `false`, or expressions using `is`, `contains`, or another such operator),
			and produces a changer that can be attached to hooks to hide them "if" the value was false.
			
			Example usage:
			`(if: $legs is 8)[You're a spider!]` will show the `You're a spider!` hook if `$legs` is `8`.
			Otherwise, it is not run.
			
			Rationale:
			In a story with multiple paths or threads, where certain events could occur or not occur,
			it's common to want to run a slightly modified version of a passage reflecting the current
			state of the world. The (if:), (unless:), (else-if:) and (else:) macros let these modifications be
			switched on or off depending on variables, comparisons or calculations of your choosing.
			
			Details:
			Note that the (if:) macro only runs once, when the passage or hook containing it is rendered. Any
			future change to the condition (such as a (link:) containing a (set:) that changes a variable) won't
			cause it to "re-run", and show/hide the hook anew.

			However, if you attach (if:) to a named hook, and the (if:) hides the hook, you can manually reveal
			the hook later in the passage (such as, after a (link:) has been clicked) by using the (show:) macro
			to target the hook. Named hooks hidden with (if:) are thus equivalent to hidden named hooks like `|this)[]`.

			Alternatives:
			The (if:) and (hidden:) macros are not the only attachment that can hide or show hooks! In fact,
			a variable that contains a boolean can be used in its place. For example:
			
			```
			(set: $foundWand to true, $foundHat to true, $foundBeard to true)
			(set: $isAWizard to $foundWand and $foundHat and $foundBeard)
			
			$isAWizard[You wring out your beard with a quick twisting spell.]
			You step into the ruined library.
			$isAWizard[The familiar scent of stale parchment comforts you.]
			```
			By storing a boolean inside `$isAWizard`, it can be used repeatedly throughout the story to
			hide or show hooks as you please.

			if you want to conditionally display very short strings, or small values inside a macro call, you may want
			to use the shorter (cond:) macro instead.

			(else-if: Boolean) -> Changer
			
			This macro's result changes depending on whether the previous hook in the passage
			was shown or hidden. If the previous hook was shown, then this changer hides the attached
			hook. Otherwise, it acts like (if:), showing the attached hook if it's true, and hiding it
			if it's false. If there was no preceding hook before this, then an error message will be printed.

			Example usage:
			```
			Your stomach makes {
			(if: $size is 'giant')[
			    an intimidating rumble! You'll have to eat plenty of trees.
			](else-if: $size is 'big')[
			    a loud growl. You're hungry for some shrubs.
			](else: )[
			    a faint gurgle. You hope to scavenge some leaves.
			]}
			```
			
			Rationale:
			If you use the (if:) macro, you may find you commonly use it in forked branches of
			source: places where only one of a set of hooks should be displayed. In order to
			make this so, you would have to phrase your (if:) expressions as "if A happened",
			"if A didn't happen and B happened", "if A and B didn't happen and C happened", and so forth,
			in that order.
			
			The (else-if:) and (else:) macros are convenient variants of (if:) designed to make this easier: you
			can merely say "if A happened", "else, if B happened", "else, if C happened" in your code.
			
			Details:
			Just like the (if:) macro, (else-if:) only checks its condition once, when the passage or hook contaning
			it is rendered.

			The (else-if:) and (else:) macros do not need to only be paired with (if:)! You can use (else-if:) and
			(else:) in conjunction with boolean variables, like so:
			```
			(set:$married to false, $date to false)
			$married[You hope this warrior will someday find the sort of love you know.]
			(else-if: not $date)[You hope this warrior isn't doing anything this Sunday (because \
			you've got overtime on Saturday.)]
			```

			If you attach (else-if:) to a named hook, and the (else-if:) hides the hook, you can reveal the hook later
			in the passage by using the (show:) macro to target the hook.

			if you want to conditionally display very short strings, or small values inside a macro call, you may want to use
			the shorter (cond:) macro instead.

		/*d:
			(else:) -> Changer
			
			This is a convenient limited variant of the (else-if:) macro. It will simply show
			the attached hook if the preceding hook was hidden, and hide it otherwise.
			If there was no preceding hook before this, then an error message will be printed.
			
			Example usage:
			```
			The coins fall... 
			\(if: (either:false, false, false, true))
				[and both land on tails! That means you've won the bet!]
			\(else: )
				[and one of them lands heads-up.]
			```

			Rationale:
			After you've written a series of hooks guarded by (if:) and (else-if:), you'll often have one final
			branch to show, when none of the above have been shown. (else:) is the "none of the above" variant
			of (else-if:), which needs no boolean expression to be provided. It's essentially the same as
			`(else-if: true)`, but shorter and more readable.
			
			For more information, see the documentation of (else-if:).
			
			Notes:
			Just like the (if:) macro, (else:) only checks its condition once, when the passage or hook contaning
			it is rendered.

			Due to a mysterious quirk, it's possible to use multiple (else:) macro calls in succession:
			```
			(set: $isUtterlyEvil to (either:true,false))
			$isUtterlyEvil[You suddenly grip their ankles and spread your warm smile into a searing smirk.]
			(else:​)[In silence, you gently, reverently rub their soles.]
			(else:​)[Before they can react, you unleash a typhoon of tickles!]
			(else:​)[They sigh contentedly, filling your pious heart with joy.]
			```
			This usage can result in a somewhat puzzling passage source structure, where each (else:) hook
			alternates between visible and hidden depending on the first such hook. So, it is best avoided.

			If you attach (else:) to a named hook, and the (else:) hides the hook, you can reveal the hook later
			in the passage by using the (show:) macro to target the hook.

			```
			The above example is the same as
			```
			Don't you recognise me? |truth)[I'm your OC, brought to life!]
			```

			Rationale:
			While there is a way to succinctly mark certain named hooks as hidden, by using parentheses instead of
			`<` or `>` marks, this macro provides a clear way for complex changers to hide their attached hooks.
			This works well when added to the (hook:) macro, for instance, to specify a hook's name and visibility
			in a single changer.

			This macro is essentially identical in behaviour to `(if:false)`, but reads better.

			This macro takes no values - each changer value it produces is the same.

		/*d:
			(verbatim:) -> Changer
			Also known as: (v6m:)

			When attached to a hook or command, the markup inside that would normally be rendered into HTML
			is instead presented as plain text, as if the verbatim markup was used on it.

			Example usage:
			``(v6m: )[ \(`A`)/ ]`` prints a kaomoji without fear of its source being interpreted as markup.

			Rationale:
			Harlowe conveniently allows you to print strings containing markup and variables, such as `"Your rank is ''$rank''"`, rendering
			them as if they were written directly in the passage. However, there are many situations where you would prefer not to do so,
			and where you can't conveniently wrap that content in the verbatim markup. Chief among these is player-inputted text: since
			players can write valid Harlowe markup into (prompt:) and (input-box:) elements, displaying such text could cause no end of
			disaster for your story. Additionally, since this text can also include unmatched verbatim markup, attempting to encase it
			in verbatim markup is non-trivially difficult. This macro provides an easier way to guarantee that the markup, if present, is not
			rendered.

			In addition, you may want to write a hook without having to worry about the task of placing its contents inside verbatim markup,
			or write a hook containing textual references to HTML or Harlowe code. Even if it turns out to be unnecessary, having this macro
			on hand can be reassuring.

			Details:
			This macro takes no values - each changer value it produces is the same.

			If you would like to use this macro to simply print a variable's contents, the (verbatim-print:) macro may be more to your liking.

		/*d:
			(live: [Number]) -> Changer
			When you attach this changer to a hook, the hook becomes "live", which means that it's repeatedly re-run
			every certain number of milliseconds, replacing the source inside of the hook with a newly computed version.
			
			Example usage:
			```
			{(live: 0.5s)[
			    (either: "Bang!", "Kaboom!", "Whammo!", "Pow!")
			]}
			```
			
			Rationale:
			Passage text generally behaves like a HTML document: it starts as code, is changed into a
			rendered page when you "open" it, and remains so until you leave. But, you may want a part of the
			page to change itself before the player's eyes, for its code to be re-renders "live"
			in front of the player, while the remainder of the passage remains the same.
			
			Certain macros, such as the (link:) macro, allow a hook to be withheld until after an element is
			interacted with. The (live:) macro is more versatile: it re-renders a hook every specified number of
			milliseconds. If (if:) or (unless:) macros are inside the hook, they of course will be re-evaluated each time.
			
			Details:
			Numbers given to macros such as (live:) can be suffixed with `ms` or `s` to indicate whether you mean milliseconds or
			seconds (see the article on number data for more information). If you give a bare number, the macro interprets it as milliseconds.

			Live hooks will continue to re-render themselves until they encounter and print a (stop:) macro. (stop:) should be used
			whenever you don't need to keep the hook "live", to save on processing and passage repainting (which can interfere
			with clicking, selecting text, and other interactions).

			As of Harlowe 3.3.4, when testing your story in Debug Mode, you can alter the speed at which (live:) waits (so as to quickly advance
			the passage to an important part, or linger on an important part) by using the "Speed" dropdown in the Tools panel. If you change it to 0.5x,
			(live:) will wait twice as long as instructed: a 1s wait will behave as if it was 2s, and so forth. Changing it to 2x will half (live:)'s wait
			time, conversely. Note that this option will currently not affect the speed of transitions (using (t8n-delay:) or (t8n-time:)).

			A note about timing: due to browser security and resource limitations, modern browsers may arbitrarily increase the delay given to (live:)
			by about 5-10ms, based on how long the (live:) macro has been running and how hard the CPU is working. More importantly,
			if the browser tab becomes inactive (such as by the player switching to another tab), modern browsers will often increase the
			delay by over 1 second, or, if the tab is inactive for a long time, any arbitrary length of time it wishes! In short, there is
			**no guarantee** that the time interval given to (live:) will actually be the time that will elapse between renders! Please
			use this macro with that limitation in mind.

			If you want to just display a hook once a certain thing happens (that is, when the condition in an (if:) macro becomes
			true) and then (stop:), then the (event:) macro may be shorter and easier to use for this. If you want to display a hook after
			a certain amount of time has passed, then the (after:) macro is almost certainly what you'd prefer to use.

			Currently, you **cannot** attach (live:) to a command (such as in `(live:2s)(link-goto:"?")`). You have to wrap the command
			in a hook (such as `(live:2s)[(link-goto:"?")]`).

		/*d:
			(event: Lambda) -> Changer

			Hooks that have this changer attached will only be run when the given condition becomes true.

			Example usage:
			This example causes a new string to be displayed after some time has passed, *or* if the (cycling-link:) cycles to a certain value.
			```
			(cycling-link: bind _recall, "Dennis?", "Denver?", "Denzel?", "Duncan?", "Danny?", "Denton?")
			(event: when time > 10s or _recall is 'Denton?')[==No, you don't remember his name. [[Go east]].
			```

			Rationale:
			While the (live:) macro is versatile in providing time-based text updating, one of its common uses - checking if some
			variable has changed using (if:), and then displaying a hook and stopping the macro with (stop:) - is rather
			cumbersome. This macro provides that functionality in a shorter form - the example above is roughly equivalent to:
			```
			(cycling-link: bind _recall, "Dennis?", "Denver?", "Denzel?", "Duncan?", "Danny?", "Denton?")
			{(live: )[
			    (if: time > 10s or _recall is 'Denton?')[
			        No, you don't remember his name. [[Go east]].(stop: )
			    ]
			]}
			```

			Details:
			This macro only takes a "when" lambda, which is like a "where" lambda but with "where" changed to
			"when" for readability purposes. This lambda doesn't have a temp variable before "when" - it doesn't iterate over anything,
			except, perhaps, moments in time.

			Because (event:) hooks only run once, the (stop:) macro is unnecessary here.

			Currently, you **cannot** attach (event:) to a command (such as in `(event: when $a is 1)(link-goto:"?")`). You have to wrap the command
			in a hook (such as `(event:when $a is 1)[(link-goto:"?")]`).

		/*d:
			(more:) -> Changer

			Hooks that have this changer attached will only be run once no other exits - links and (click:)-enchanted areas - are remaining
			in the passage, and will reveal "more" prose.

			Example usage:
			```
			(link:"Look at the duck.")[The duck drifts on the lake's surface.]
			(link:"Look at the clouds.")[Seems like rain, which is bad news for just one of you.]
			(more:)[You've looked at the duck, and the clouds.]
			```

			Rationale:
			It's common to use hook-revealing macros like (link:) to provide elaboration on a scene, which the player can encounter in any order
			they wish. You may want to require each of these elaborations and details be visited by the player, only displaying the link to
			the next passage (or further story-setting material) after they have all been explored. You could implement this using `(event: when exits is 0)`,
			but this macro, (more:), provides a shorter and more readable alternative.

			Details:
			This is functionally identical to `(event: when exits is 0)`. For more information on what is and is not considered an "exit", see the article
			for the "exits" keyword.

			If multiple (more:) elements are in the passage, they will appear in the order they appear. This may cause earlier ones to reveal
			links inside their hooks, and thus "block" the subsequent ones from revealing. In the case of
			`(more:)[You see [[an exit]] ahead.] (more:)[But you hear chuckling behind you...]`, the first (more:) hook will reveal
			a passage link, thus causing the second hook to not be revealed.

			(after: Number, [Number]) -> Changer

			Hooks that have this changer attached will only be run once the given amount of time has passed since the passage was rendered. An
			optional second number specifies that the player can speed up the delay by holding down a keyboard key or mouse button, or by touching the touch device.

			Example usage:
			This example makes 3 additional hooks appear, one by one. The delays can only be sped up if the passage has been visited before.
			The `time + 2s` idiom is a convenient way to express that each hook is displayed 2 seconds after the last one was displayed (as the `time` identifier
			tracks the time passed since the passage was rendered, not the containing hook).
			```
			There she was. (after: 2s, (cond: visits > 0, 200ms, 0))[=
			Covered in fur, (after: time + 2s, (cond: visits > 0, 200ms, 0))[=
			sitting on all fours, (after: time + 2s, (cond: visits > 0, 200ms, 0))[=
			and howling at the moon.
			```

			Rationale:
			This macro is a shorthand form of (event:) that only is given an amount of time to wait. `(after:2s)` is the same as `(event: when time > 2s)`.
			It is also similar to (live:), except that it only runs the hook at most once.

			One significant difference this has over (event:) is that it can offer the player the ability to speed up transitions. Frequently asking the player to wait for timed delays
			can be detrimental to the pacing of a story, especially if they are revisiting earlier passages, and providing an option to skip or expedite them is often
			greatly appreciated.

			Details:
			Numbers given to macros such as (after:) can be suffixed with `ms` or `s` to indicate whether you mean milliseconds or
			seconds (see the article on number data for more information). If you give a bare number, the macro interprets it as milliseconds.

			The optional second number given is an amount of milliseconds (or, if suffixed with `s`, seconds) to advance the transition. For each
			millisecond of the transition, Harlowe checks if a key or button is held, and if so, then it is advanced
			by the given number (in addition to the elapsed millisecond).

			As of Harlowe 3.3.4, when testing your story in Debug Mode, you can alter the speed at which (after:) waits (so as to quickly advance
			the passage to an important part, or linger on an important part) by using the "Speed" dropdown in the Tools panel. If you change it to 0.5x,
			(after:) will wait twice as long as instructed: a 1s wait will behave as if it was 2s, and so forth. Changing it to 2x will half (after:)'s wait
			time, conversely. Note that this option will currently not affect the speed of transitions (using (t8n-delay:) or (t8n-time:)).

			A note about timing: due to browser security and resource limitations, modern browsers may arbitrarily increase the delay given to (after:)
			by about 5-10ms, based on how long the (after:) macro has been in the passage, and how hard the CPU is working. More importantly,
			if the browser tab becomes inactive (such as by the player switching to another tab), modern browsers will often increase the
			delay by over 1 second, or, if the tab is inactive for a long time, any arbitrary length of time it wishes! In short, there is
			**no guarantee** that the time interval given to (after:) will actually be the time that will elapse before the hook appears! Please
			use this macro with that limitation in mind.

			(after-error:) -> Changer

			A bug-specific event macro, this hides the hook and only causes it to run once an error occurs.

			Example usage:
			```
			(after-error:)[
				(dialog:"Sorry, folks, seems like I messed up.
			DM me on GregsGameMakingBungalow with a screenshot!")
			]\
			(link:"Click here for an error")[Can't use (metadata: ) here!]
			```

			Rationale:
			While you should generally test your story enough to be fairly certain that no error messages will occur,
			it can sometimes be difficult to be absolutely certain. As such, you may want to be prepared for the worst.
			If an error message does occur, you might want to show a custom message of your own to the player, instructing
			them to report the bug in your story, or giving them a chance to continue the story from a later passage. (You may want
			to use this in a "header" or "footer" tagged passage, so that this notification message may appear anywhere in the story.)

			Alternatively, you may want to use it during testing, by combining it with the (debug:) command macro, so that
			the Debug Mode panel will pop up when the first error occurs, potentially letting testers obtain deeper information
			about the game's current state.

			Details:
			This will only display the attached hook at the moment an error message is displayed. If this is used inside a larger hook
			which only appears after an error is displayed, its attached hook won't appear until another error occurs.

			(hook: String) -> Changer
			A changer that allows the author to give a hook a computed tag name.
			
			Example usage:
			`(hook: $name)[]` gives the hook a name equal to what string is in the $name variable.
			
			Rationale:
			It's possible to add together changers, save them in variables, and use them in various locations
			throughout your story. You may, after doing so, want to give a common name to each of those hooks that
			have that variable attached, so that, for instance, the (append:) macro can act on them as one.
			This changer can be added to those changers to allow the hooks to be named, like so.
			`(font:"Museo Slab")+(hook:"title")`.
			
			Also, unlike the nametag syntax for hook names, (hook:) can be given any string expression:
			`(hook: "eyes" + (str:$eyeCount))` is valid, and will, as you'd expect, give the hook
			the name of `eyes1` if `$eyeCount` is 1.

			Details:
			If an empty string is given to this macro, an error will be produced.

			Currently, you may give strings with non-alphanumeric characters in them, such as "!@#". However, since those characters
			are not valid for use in HookName syntax, you can't use a HookName to refer to that hook, so it's not that useful.

			Hook names are case-insensitive and dash-insensitive. This means that `(hook:"BAG")`, `(hook:"bag ")` and `(hook:"bag")`
			are all equivalent.

			(hidden:), (hooks-named:)

		/*d:
			(for: Lambda, [...Any]) -> Changer
			Also known as: (loop:)

			When attached to a hook, this repeats the attached hook, setting a temporary variable to a different value on each repeat.

			Example usage:
			* `(for: each _item, ...$arr) [You have the _item.]` prints "You have the " and the item, for each item in $arr.
			* `(for: _ingredient where it contains "petal", ...$reagents) [Cook the _ingredient?]` prints "Cook the " and the string, for
			each string in $reagents which contains "petal".

			Rationale:
			Suppose you're using arrays to store strings representing inventory items, or character datamaps,
			or other kinds of sequential game information - or even just built-in arrays like (history:) - and you
			want to print out a sentence or paragraph for each item. The (for:) macro can be used to print something "for each"
			item in an array easily - simply write a hook using a temp variable where each item should be printed or used,
			then give (for:) an "each" lambda that uses the same temp variable.

			Details:
			If no extra values are given after the lambda (for instance, by using `...` with an empty array), then nothing will happen
			and the attached hook will not be printed at all.

			Don't make the mistake of believing you can alter an array by trying to (set:) the temp variable in each loop - such
			as `(for: each _a, ...$arr)[(set: _a to it + 1)]`. This will NOT change $arr - only the temp variable will change (and
			only until the next loop, where another $arr value will be put into it). If you want to alter an array item-by-item, use
			the (altered:) macro.

			The temp variable inside the hook will shadow any other identically-named temp variables outside of it: if you
			`(set: _a to 1)`, then `(for: each _a, 2,3)[ (print: _a) ]`, the inner hook will print "2" and "3", and you won't be
			able to print or set the "outer" _a.

			You may want to simply print several copies of a hook a certain number of times, without any particular
			array data being looped over. You can use the (range:) macro with it instead: `(for: each _i, ...(range:1,10))`, and
			not use the temp variable inside the hook at all.

			As it is a changer macro, (for:)'s value is a changer which can be stored in a variable - this command stores all
			of the values originally given to it, and won't reflect any changes to the values, or their container arrays, since then.

			Alternatives:
			You may be tempted to use (for:) not to print anything at all, but to find values inside arrays using (if:), or
			form a "total" using (set:). The lambda macros (find:) and (folded:), while slightly less straightforward,
			are recommended to be used instead.

			(transition: String) -> Changer
			Also known as: (t8n:)
			
			A changer that applies a built-in CSS transition to a hook as it appears. Give this macro one of these strings (capitalisation and hyphens ignored):
			`"instant"`, `"dissolve"`, `"fade"`, `"rumble"`, `"shudder"`, `"pulse"`, `"zoom"`, `"flicker"`, `"slide-left"`, `"slide-right"`, `"slide-up"`, `"slide-down"`,
			`"fade-left"`, `"fade-right"`, `"fade-up"` and `"fade-down"`.
			
			Example usage:
			`(t8n: "pulse")[Gleep!]` makes the hook `[Gleep!]` use the "pulse" transition
			when it appears.
			
			Details:
			At present, the following text strings will produce a particular transition:
			* "instant" (causes the hook to instantly appear)
			* "dissolve" or "fade" (causes the hook to gently fade in)
			* "flicker" (causes the hook to roughly flicker in - don't use with a long (transition-time:))
			* "shudder" (causes the hook to instantly appear while shaking back and forth)
			* "rumble" (causes the hook to instantly appear while shaking up and down)
			* "slide-right" (causes the hook to slide in from left to right)
			* "slide-left" (causes the hook to slide in from right to left)
			* "slide-up" (causes the hook to slide in from bottom to top)
			* "slide-down" (causes the hook to slide in from top to bottom)
			* "fade-right" (causes the hook to gently fade in while sliding rightward)
			* "fade-left" (causes the hook to gently fade in while sliding leftward)
			* "fade-up" (causes the hook to gently fade in while sliding upward)
			* "fade-down" (causes the hook to gently fade in while sliding downward)
			* "pulse" (causes the hook to instantly appear while pulsating rapidly)
			* "zoom" (causes the hook to scale up from the mouse pointer)
			* "blur" (causes the hook to appear from a blur)
			
			All transitions are 0.8 seconds long, unless a (transition-time:) changer is added
			to the changer.

			You can't combine transitions by adding them together, like you can with (text-style:) -
			`(t8n:"dissolve")+(t8n:"shudder")` won't make a transition that simultaneously dissolve-fades and shudders.

			While you can attach this to (link-show:) to change the transitions it uses, you can't use this macro to change
			the passage transitions used by links or (link-goto:), and trying to do so will cause an error. Please use
			(transition-depart:) or (transition-arrive:) for this purpose instead.

			The "blur" transition will not work in Internet Explorer 10 or 11.

		/*d:
			(transition-skip: Number) -> Changer
			Also known as: (t8n-skip:)
			
			A changer that, when added to a (transition:) changer, allows the player to skip or accelerate the transition by
			holding down a keyboard key or mouse button, or by touching the touch device.

			Example usage:
			`(t8n:"slide-right")+(t8n-time:3s)+(t8n-skip:0.2s)[OK! I'm comin'!]` makes the text slide in from the right,
			but only after 3 seconds have passed... but if the player holds a key, mouse button, or the screen, it gets
			advanced by an additional 0.2 seconds each millisecond they hold.

			Rationale:
			It's tempting to use transitions a lot in your story, but these can come at a cost to the player - watching
			and waiting for transitions to complete can be tiring and detrimental to your story's pacing, especially
			if they have to revisit certain parts of your story a lot. This macro can help by providing them with a means
			of skipping or accelerating the transitions if they so choose.

			Details:
			The number given is an amount of milliseconds (or, if suffixed with `s`, seconds) to advance the transition. For each
			millisecond of the transition, Harlowe checks if a key or button is held, and if so, then it is advanced
			by the given number (in addition to the elapsed millisecond).

			If a non-positive number is given, an error will be produced.

			This effect advances both a transition's (transition-time:)s and (transition-delay:)s.

			Example usage:
			* `(t8n-depart: "dissolve")[[Next morning]]` changes the `[[Next morning]]` link, such
			that clicking it takes you to the "Next morning" passage with the current passage smoothly fading out
			instead of instantly disappearing.

			(button: [String]) -> Changer

			When applied to a link, this changer styles it so that it resembles a button, and makes it take up the entire passage width. The optional sizing
			string lets you specify width and horizontal margins for the button. It is not recommended that this be used on non-link hooks.

			Example usage:
			* `(button:)[[Go to the cemetery]]` applies the button style to a single passage link.
			* `(button:"=XXX=")[[Hug your husband]]` turns the link into a button that occupies 60% of the available width, centered.
			* `(enchant:?link's 2ndlast + ?link's last, (button:))` enchants the second-last and last links in the passage with the button style.

			Rationale:
			Harlowe links, by default, are designed to appear inside and among prose, in the manner of HTML prose. That being said, a story written in a more
			traditional interactive fiction style will often want to finish a passage with a series of exit links. These links can benefit from being more
			visually prominent and inviting, rather than just single fragments of text. The (button:) changer provides links with a styling that is more typical
			of other interactive fiction engines' link options.

			Details:
			This is essentially a shortcut for a number of other changers added together. `(link: "Link Text", (button:))` is similar to
			`(link:"Link Text",(align:"=><=")+(box:"X")+(b4r:"solid")+(css:"padding:0px")+(corner-radius:16))`. However, unlike the latter,
			this changer is designed to work correctly with (click:) and `(enchant:"text")`, so that the button border matches the current link colour.

			The optional sizing string is the same kind of line given to (box:) - a sequence of zero or more `=` signs, then a sequence of characters (preferably "X"), then zero or
			more `=` signs. Think of this string as a visual depiction of the button's horizontal proportions - the `=` signs are the space to
			the left and right, and the characters in the middle are the button itself.

			To make (button:) links appear in two or more columns, or make two (button:) links appear side-by-side, consider using the column markup.

			This changer can be provided to non-link hooks or commands, but since the result will have the same borders and spacing as a button while not
			being clickable, it is not recommended to use it this way.

			This changer adds the class "enchantment-button" to `<tw-link>` and `<tw-enchantment>` elements.

			(action: String) -> Changer

			When attached to a link command, or given to a link changer macro as the second value, this changer turns the link into a different
			kind of interaction element with a different appearance - one that is either activated by hovering the mouse pointer over it, hoving the mouse pointer
			off of it, or double-clicking it. This does nothing when attached or supplied to a non-link hook.

			Example usage:

			You kiss her on the (link: "lips.",(action:'mouseout'))[mouth that once sneered so cruelly at you.]
			
			Hold my (link-reveal:"hand.",(action:'mouseout'))[ Thank you.]
			```

			Rationale:
			Even though Harlowe (and Twine in general) is primarily a tool for writing serious non-linear prose works, it is also meant as a tool
			for playful, experimental, and abstract works where the act of interaction with the text is put into focus. To that end,
			macros like this one exist to provide alternative, unusual or unexpected ways for the player to interact with links.

			Since these actions (especially double-clicking) differ from the usual convention of hyperlinks, it is recommended that your story
			explains these kinds of links to the player. Or, if you'd prefer to surprise or conceal something from the player, you may choose not to,
			and leave them to discover these interactions for themselves.

			Details:
			
			The string values this accepts are listed below. Note that these strings are case-insensitive and dash-insensitive.

			| --- | --- | ---
			| `"mouseover"` | <t-s style="border-bottom: 2px dashed #999"></t-s> | Move the mouse over the link to activate it (or press it on a touch device).
			| `"mouseout"` | <t-s mouseout style="border: rgba(64,149,191,.6) 1px solid;border-radius: .2em;"></t-s> | Move the mouse onto the link, then off it, to activate it (or press it on a touch device).
			| `"doubleclick"` | <t-s doubleclick style="border: 2px solid #999;"></t-s> | Double-click (or double-press) the link to activate it.
			| `"click"` | | An unchanged link that is activated by clicking.

			These actions cannot be combined - `(action:'doubleclick')+(action:'click')` will only behave like `(action:'click')`.

			Each of these actions causes the links to have a slightly different sensation and mood to a normal link. `"mouseover"` conveys a mood of fragility and spontaneity in your stories, of text reacting to the merest of touches.
			`"mouseout"` conveys a sense of "pointing" at the element to interact with it rather than "touching" it, and gives a dream-like or unearthly air to scenes or places.
			`"doubleclick"` requires a more forceful interaction than clicking, and is commonly associated with desktop operating systems and the concept of "opening".
			
			Because this fundamentally changes the manner in which the link is interacted with, **this currently does nothing** when given to (enchant:), (enchant-in:), (line-style:), or other such macros.

			It is *not* recommended using this with (click:) to enchant a hook which already contains a link.

			While you can write something like `(click:?Page, (action:"mouseover"))`, the result won't be that interesting: if the mouse pointer is anywhere
			on the page, the hook to which the (click:) changer is attached will immediately run.

			(border: String, [String], [String], [String]) -> Changer
			Also known as: (b4r:)

			A changer macro that applies a CSS border to the hook.

			Example usage:
			```
			(b4r:"dotted")[I love you!
			I want to be your wife!]
			```

			Details:

			The border macros accept up to four values. These values refer to *sides of a rectangle*, going clockwise
			from the top: the first value is the **top** edge (12 o'clock), second is the **right** edge (3 o'clock),
			third is the **bottom** edge (6 o'clock), fourth is the **left** edge (9 o'clock). You can stop giving
			values anywhere. If an edge doesn't have a value, then it will use whatever the opposite edge's value is.

			* `(border: "solid", "dotted", "dashed", "double")` provides all four sides.
			* `(border: "solid", "dotted", "dashed")` stops at the bottom edge, so the left edge will use "dotted", to match
			the right edge.
			* `(border: "solid", "dotted")` stops at the right edge, so the bottom edge will use "solid", to match
			the top edge, and the left edge will use "dotted", to match the right edge.
			* `(border: "solid")` causes all of the edges to use "solid".

			This macro affects the style of the border, and accepts the following border names.

			| String | Example
			| --- | ---
			| "none" | Example text
			| "solid" | <span style="border: 2px solid black;margin:2px;display:inline-block">Example text</span>
			| "dotted" | <span style="border: 2px dotted black;margin:2px;display:inline-block">Example text</span>
			| "dashed" | <span style="border: 2px dashed black;margin:2px;display:inline-block">Example text</span>
			| "double" | <span style="border: 2px double black;margin:2px;display:inline-block">Example text</span>
			| "groove" | <span style="border: 2px groove black;margin:2px;display:inline-block">Example text</span>
			| "ridge" | <span style="border: 2px ridge black;margin:2px;display:inline-block">Example text</span>
			| "inset" | <span style="border: 2px inset black;margin:2px;display:inline-block">Example text</span>
			| "outset" | <span style="border: 2px outset black;margin:2px;display:inline-block">Example text</span>

			The "none" type can be used to remove a border that another changer may have included. NOTE: As of Harlowe 3.2.2,
			this can only be used to remove borders from combined changers, such as by `(set: $changer to it + (b4r:"none"))`,
			and can't be used to remove borders from already-changed hooks or other structures.

			The default size of the border, with no other CSS changes to any elements, is 2px (2 pixels),
			unless a change is applied using (border-size:).

			Due to browser CSS limitations, the border will force the hook to become a single rectangular area. The hook can
			no longer word-wrap, and moreover occupies every line in which its text is contained. So, this changer is best
			suited for entire paragraphs of text (or hooks using the (box:) changer) rather than single words or phrases.

		/*d:
			(border-size: Number, [Number], [Number], [Number]) -> Changer
			Also known as: (b4r-size:)

			When applied to a hook being changed by the (border:) changer, this multiplies the size
			of the border by a given amount.

			Example usage:
			`(b4r:"solid")+(b4r-size:4)[Do not read anything outside of this box.]`

			Details:

			The border macros accept up to four values. These values refer to *sides of a rectangle*, going clockwise
			from the top: the first value is the **top** edge (12 o'clock), second is the **right** edge (3 o'clock),
			third is the **bottom** edge (6 o'clock), fourth is the **left** edge (9 o'clock). You can stop giving
			values anywhere. If an edge doesn't have a value, then it will use whatever the opposite edge's value is
			(or the top value if it's the only one).

			The default size of borders added using (border:) is 2px (2 pixels). The number given is a number of
			CSS pixels to set the new size to. Since CSS pixels don't exactly correspond to display pixels
			(such as, for instance, if the browser window is zoomed in) then it's possible to have a non-whole
			number of CSS pixels (such as 1.5, which would, if the browser window was zoomed in to 200%, become
			3 display pixels). Thus, this macro accepts numbers with fractional values. That being said,
			if a number lower than 0 is given, an error will be produced.

		/*d:
			(corner-radius: Number, [Number], [Number], [Number]) -> Changer

			When applied to a hook, this rounds the corners by the given number of pixels, causing the hook
			to become increasingly round or button-like.

			Example usage:
			```
			(b4r:'solid')+(corner-radius:8)[Hasn't this gone on too long?]
			(b4r:'solid')+(corner-radius:12)[Shouldn't you tell them the truth?]
			(b4r:'solid')+(corner-radius:16)[//That you're not really who you say you are??//]
			```

			Details:
			The border macros accept up to four values. These values refer to *corners of a rectangle*, going clockwise
			from the top: the first value is the **top-left** corner (10 o'clock), second is the **top-right** corner (2 o'clock),
			third is the **bottom-right** corner (4 o'clock), fourth is the **bottom-left** corner (8 o'clock). You can stop giving
			values anywhere. If a corner doesn't have a value, then it will use whatever the opposite corner's value is
			(or the top-left value if it's the only one).

			Obviously, unless the hook has a (bg:) or a (border:), the rounded corners will not be visible, and this
			changer will have no real effect.

			If the hook has a (border:), values greater than the border's (border-width:) (which is 2 if it wasn't changed)
			will cause the interior of the element to become constrained by the curvature of the corners, as the
			rectangle's corners get cut off. Because of this, this macro also adds interior padding (distance between the
			border and the contained text) equal to each of the passed-in numbers, unless another changer (such as (css:))
			provided a different padding value.

		/*d:
			(border-colour: String or Colour, [String or Colour], [String or Colour], [String or Colour]) -> Changer
			Also known as: (b4r-colour:), (border-color:), (b4r-color:)

			When applied to a hook being changed by the (border:) changer, this changes the border's colour.

			Example usage:
			* `(b4r-color:magenta)+(b4r:"ridge")[LEVEL 01: DREAM WORLD]`
			* `(b4r-color:red,yellow,green,blue)+(b4r:"dotted")[Isn't it a lovely time?]`

			Details:

			Much like (text-colour:), this accepts either a Colour (such as those produced by (hsl:) or (rgb:), or plain literals
			like `#fff`), or a CSS colour string.

			Certain (border:) styles, namely "ridge", "groove", "inset" and "outset", will modify the colour,
			darkening it for certain parts of the border to produce their namesake appearance.

			Selecting `"transparent"` as the colour will cause the border to "disappear", but also cause the space surrounding
			the hook to remain.

			Example usage:
			`(opacity: 0.5)[You don't think there's (color:green)[a revenant] nearby, do you?]` makes the hook 50% transparent.
			
			Details:
			This affects the entire hook, including its background, any borders added by (border:), and so forth. Moreover, this does not override
			"alpha" opacity values of colours produced by (hsl:), (rgb:) and (lch:) – the multiple transparency effects produced by these will
			multiplicatively stack with one another.

			Each nested usage of (opacity:) also multiplicatively stacks with one another. If two hooks with opacity 0.5 are nested, such as by `(opacity:0.5)[(opacity:0.5)[Faded]]`,
			then the inner hook will have an opacity equivalent to 0.25. As a consequence of this, you can't use (opacity:) inside a partially transparent hook
			to bring the inner hook up to 100% opacity.

			Two (text-style:) styles, "fade-in-out" and "opacity", will override this changer if it's affecting the same hook.

			Example usage:

			This styling changer causes the attached hook to be indented by the given number of pixels.

			* `(text-indent: 24)+(size:1.5)[CHAPTER TWO]` makes just this hook have a leading indent of 24 pixels.

			Rationale:
			Indentation of initial letters has long been used in typesetting as a means of helping the human eye distinguish paragraphs of
			text from each other. While you can use line breaks to separate paragraphs, this often takes up an uncomfortable amount of vertical space,
			and can be unsuitable for long sections of prose. This macro can be used to provide indentation to single hooks, or, using (change:) or (enchant:),
			to every line in a passage.

			Details:
			This will place a gap before the first character of the attached hook, even if it isn't at the start of a line.

			The given number is the number of CSS pixels to indent the hook by. If it is negative, an error will be produced.

			Because this uses the CSS 'text-indent' attribute, hooks using this macro will have their CSS `display` attribute
			set to `inline-block`.

			It is recommended that you do NOT use this macro for precisely placing text offset from the left or right of the passage.

			(text-rotate-x: Number) -> Changer

			This styling changer visually rotates the attached hook clockwise, around the X axis (horizontal), by a given number of
			degrees, making it appear to lean into the page. The rotational axis is in the centre of the hook.

			Example usage:
			```
			(text-rotate-x:-45)[You feel a strange

			lightness, as if you're

			in an elevator that's

			suddenly started

			plunging rapidly.]
			```
			
			Details:

			The surrounding non-rotated text will behave as if the rotated text is still in its original position -
			the horizontal space of its original length will be preserved, and text it overlaps with vertically will
			ignore it.

			A rotation of 90 degrees will, due to the rotational axis, cause the hook to disappear, appearing edge-on to the viewer.
			A rotation of 180 degrees will, due to the rotational axis, flip the hook upside-down, as if `(text-style:"upside-down")` was applied.

			Due to browser limitations, hooks using this macro will have its CSS `display` attribute
			set to `inline-block`.

			(bg: Colour or String or Gradient) -> Changer
			Also known as: (background:)

			This styling changer alters the background colour or background image
			of the attached hook. Supplying a gradient (produced by (gradient:)) will set the
			background to that gradient. Supplying a colour (produced by (rgb:), (hsl:), (lch:) or another such macro),
			a built-in colour value like `red`, or a bare colour value like #FA9138) will set
			the background to a flat colour. CSS strings that resemble HTML hex colours (like "#FA9138") will
			also provide flat colour. Other strings will be interpreted as an image URL,
			and the background will be set to it.

			Example usage:
			* `(bg: red + white)[Pink background]`
			* `(bg: (gradient: 0, 0,red, 1,black))[Red-black gradient background]`
			* `(bg: #663399)[Purple background]`
			* `(bg: "#663399")[Purple background]`
			* `(bg: "marble.png")[Marble texture background]`

			Details:
			
			Combining two (bg:) changers will do nothing if they both influence the
			colour or the image. For instance `(bg:red) + (bg:white)` will simply
			produce the equivalent `(bg:white)`. However, `(bg:red) + (bg:"mottled.png")`
			will work as intended if the background image contains transparency, allowing the background
			colour to appear through it. Note that gradients count as background images, not colours - you can
			combine gradients whose colours are partially transparent with flat colours, such as
			`(bg: (gradient: 90, 0, (hsla:0,0,0,0.5), 1, (hsla:0,0,0,0))) + (bg: red)`

			Currently, supplying other CSS colour names (such as `burlywood`) is not
			permitted - they will be interpreted as image URLs regardless.

			No error will be reported if the image at the given URL cannot be accessed.

			(text-style: ...String) -> Changer
			
			This applies one or more selected built-in text styles to the hook's text. Give this macro one of these strings (capitalisation and hyphens ignored):
			`"none"`, `"bold"`, `"italic"`, `"underline"`, `"double-underline"`, `"wavy-underline"`, `"strike"`, `"double-strike"`, `"wavy-strike"`, `"superscript"`,
			`"subscript"`, `"blink"`, `"shudder"`, `"mark"`, `"condense"`, `"expand"`, `"outline"`, `"shadow"`, `"emboss"`, `"smear"`, `"blur"`, `"blurrier"`,
			`"mirror"`, `"upside-down"`, `"tall"`, `"flat"`, `"fade-in-out"`, `"rumble"`, `"sway"`, `"buoy"` or `"fidget"`.
			
			Example usage:
			* `The shadow (text-style: "shadow")[flares] at you!` will style the word "flares" with a shadow.
			* `(set: $s to (text-style: "shadow")) The shadow $s[flares] at you!` will also style it with a shadow.
			* `(text-style: "italic", "emboss")[Richard Donahue, King for Hire]` makes the text italic and embossed.
			
			Rationale:
			While Harlowe offers markup for common formatting styles like bold and italic, having these
			styles available from a changer macro provides some extra benefits: it's possible, as with all
			such style macros, to (set:) them into a variable, combine them with other changers, and re-use them
			succinctly throughout the story (by using the variable in place of the macro).
			
			Furthermore, this macro also offers many less common but equally desirable styles to the author,
			which are otherwise unavailable or difficult to produce.
			
			Details:
			At present, the following text strings will produce a particular style. All of these are case-insensitive and dash-insensitive - "UPSIDE-DOWN" and "upsidedown" both work in place of "upside-down".

			You can use the "none" style to remove an existing style from a combined changer. NOTE: As of Harlowe 3.2.2,
			this can only be used to remove styles from combined changers, such as by `(set: $changer to it + (text-style:"none"))`,
			and can't be used to remove styles from already-changed hooks or other structures.

			Due to browser limitations, combining many of these changers won't work exactly as intended – `(text-style: "underline", "strike")`, for instance,
			will cause only the latter of the two to be applied, in this case "strike". These incompatibilities are listed in the table above.
			
			Also due to browser limitations, hooks using "mirror", "upside-down", "tall", or "flat" will have their CSS `display` attribute set to `inline-block`. This means, among other
			things, that the text inside them won't word-wrap.

			Note that the animations "rumble" and "shudder" are particularly intense, and may induce frustration or illness in
			motion-sensitive readers. Take care when using them.

			Finally, "doublestrike" and "scribble" will be replaced with "strike" when run on Internet Explorer, as will "double-underline" and
			"wavy-underline" be replaced with "underline".

			(collapse:) -> Changer

			When attached to a hook, this collapses the whitespace within the hook, in the same manner as the collapsing whitespace markup.

			Example usage:
			* `(collapse:)[This text is (set:$a to 1) collapsed.]`
			* `(enchant: ?page, (collapse:))`

			Rationale:
			While the collapsing whitespace markup allows specific sections of passage prose to be collapsed, there are times when you want
			this functionality available as a changer, such as to style the whole page using (change:), or to add it to another changer.
			This macro provides that functionality.

			Details:
			Unlike most macros, this takes no values - there is only one way of collapsing whitespace (for now).

			This collapses whitespace in the same manner as the collapsing whitespace markup, so consult its documentation for more information.

			There is no way to reverse this whitespace-collapsing effect - it is permanently removed.

			When this is used with (change:) or (enchant:) to affect an existing hook, its excess whitespace will be deleted immediately, with no transition.
			Moreover, the whitespace-collapsing effect is ongoing, not just a once-off effect. This becomes clear when you consider
			the following code.
			```
			(enchant:?1, (collapse:))
			|1>["Back in time? Is this a time travel story now?"]
			(append:?1)[
				he shook his head.
			]
			```
			Because the enchantment is an ongoing effect, the text appended to ?1 will be collapsed, even though it's written outside of the collapsing hook.
			This would not occur if ?1 was a span of collapsing whitespace markup.

		/*d:
			(hover-style: Changer) -> Changer

			Given a style-altering changer, it makes a changer which only applies when the hook or command is hovered over
			with the mouse pointer, and is removed when hovering off.

			Example usage:
			* `(enchant:?Link, (hover-style:(text-style:'italic')))` makes each of the page's links turn italic when hovered over.
			* `(text-colour:transparent)+(hover-style:(text-color:red))[The butler] killed Marcus O'Fogarty.` makes a hook, whose
			text is normally transparent, turn white when hovered over.
			* `(hover-style:)[]`

			Rationale:
			Making text react in small visual ways when the pointer hovers over it is an old hypertext tradition. It lends a
			degree of "life" to the text, making it seem aware of the player. This feeling of life is best used to signify
			interactivity - it seems to invite the player to answer in turn, by clicking. So, adding them to (link:) commands,
			as well as interaction commands like (cycling-link:), is recommended.

			Details:
			True to its name, this macro can only be used for subtle style changes. Only the following changers (and combinations
			thereof) may be given to (hover-style:) - any others will produce an error:
			* (align:)
			* (bg:)
			* (css:)
			* (font:)
			* (text-colour:)
			* (text-indent:)
			* (text-rotate-x:)
			* (text-rotate-y:)
			* (text-rotate-z:)
			* (text-style:)
			* (text-size:)
			
			More extensive mouse-based interactivity should use the (action:) changer.

			This macro is not recommended for use in games or stories intended for use on touch devices, as
			the concept of "hovering" over an element doesn't really make sense with that input method.

			Note that in versions of Harlowe prior to 3.2.0, this could be combined with (link:), (link-repeat:), or (link-reveal:)
			to apply changers to the link, except for (text-colour:). This has since been changed, and now, when combined with (link:)
			changers, (hover-style:) will only apply to the revealed hook. (The intended way to style the link in that case is to provide (hover-style:) as
			the optional second value to a link changer, such as by `(link-rerun:"Retry", (hover-style:(color:red)))`.)
			Note that `(link-goto:)` and passage links aren't changers, so (hover-style:) can be attached to them, as expected.

			If you want to test your passage, while ignoring a specific changer macro in it, temporarily change that
			changer macro's name to (test-true:), and it will ignore all of the data given to it, while enabling the hook.

			Example usage:
			* `(test-true: $eggs is 1)[Only one egg remaining!]` features an (if:) macro that has been temporarily changed to (test-true:).

			Rationale:
			While testing your passage, you may wish to examine what would happen if a changer, such as (if:) or (else:), were to have no effect on its hook.
			But, removing and adding the macro from your passage code may get tedious and error-prone, especially if you need to disable several such
			changers at once. Instead, you can simply temporarily change the macro's name to (test-true:), and change it back later. Regardless of what data is given
			to this macro (colour data for (bg:), booleans for (if:), hooks for (replace:)), this macro won't cause an error.

			Details:
			While it will ignore all well-formed data given to it, (test-true:) will NOT suppress errors that are already present in the data.
			For instance, `(test-true: 5 + "3")[]` will still cause an error.

			If (test-true:) and another changer are added together, such as in `(test-true:)+(if:visits is 1)`, then the latter changer will take precedence and
			override it.

			(test-false: [...Any]) -> Changer

			If you want to test your passage in order to see what would happen if an (if:), (unless:) or (else-if:) macro would hide the hook it's attached to,
			you can temporarily change the name of the macro to (test-false:), which causes it to ignore the data given to it and act as if it was given `false`.

			Example usage:
			* `(test-false: $eggs is 1)[Only one egg remaining!]` features an (if:) macro that has been temporarily changed to (test-false:).

			Rationale:
			This is a counterpart of (test-true:), designed specifically for testing hooks with (if:), (unless:) and (else-if:) changers attached. For most
			changers, using (test-true:) is sufficient to temporarily suppress the effect of the changer. However, if you want the hook to remain
			hidden by default during the test, then using (test-true:) would still cause the hook to be displayed. While you could temporarily attach
			(hidden:) to the hook as well, this can be cumbersome, especially if that would involve adding an additional changer to a long
			sequence of changers attached to that hook. (test-false:) provides a more convenient alternative.

			Details:
			While it will ignore all well-formed data given to it, (test-false:) will NOT suppress errors that are already present in the data.
			For instance, `(test-false: 5 + "3")[]` will still cause an error.

	/*d:
		(animate: HookName, String, [Number]) -> Command

		A command that causes a hook to briefly animate, as if a (transition:) was applied to it. The length of time that the animation plays can be optionally
		altered by providing a number.

		Example usage:
		`(after: 15s)[You'd better get going now, pardner. (animate:?passage's links, "rumble")]` causes all of the links in the passage to briefly
		shake using the "rumble" transition after 15 seconds have passed.

		Rationale:
		Transitions allow incoming text to animate in a visually stylish fashion, but there are times you might want already displayed text to suddenly animate,
		as if it had just transitioned in anew. This command can be useful, when used sparingly, to draw the attention of the player toward a particular part
		of the passage, such as a link, or an easily missed word, after they click a link or wait a certain amount of time. It can be particularly interesting
		when used to draw attention to a part that, until then, had nothing visually remarkable about it, so as to highlight it for only a moment.

		Details:
		(animate:) recognises the same transition names as (transition:), except for "instant" (which obviously cannot be animated). These names are:

		* "dissolve" or "fade" (causes the hook to gently fade in)
		* "flicker" (causes the hook to roughly flicker in - don't use with a long (transition-time:))
		* "shudder" (causes the hook to instantly appear while shaking back and forth)
		* "rumble" (causes the hook to instantly appear while shaking up and down)
		* "slide-right" (causes the hook to slide in from left to right)
		* "slide-left" (causes the hook to slide in from right to left)
		* "slide-up" (causes the hook to slide in from bottom to top)
		* "slide-down" (causes the hook to slide in from top to bottom)
		* "fade-right" (causes the hook to gently fade in while sliding rightward)
		* "fade-left" (causes the hook to gently fade in while sliding leftward)
		* "fade-up" (causes the hook to gently fade in while sliding upward)
		* "fade-down" (causes the hook to gently fade in while sliding downward)
		* "pulse" (causes the hook to instantly appear while pulsating rapidly)
		* "zoom" (causes the hook to scale up from the mouse pointer)
		* "blur" (causes the hook to appear from a blur)

		The optional time value, which alters the animation's length of time, corresponds to (transition-time:). Additional alterations to the animation
		can be given by attaching the other two transition changers, (transition-delay:) and (transition-skip:), to this command.

		You may notice that other, permanent animations are available as (text-style:) options. (animate:)'s animations operate separately to those,
		and animations unique to (text-style:) can't be temporarily applied with this macro. Instead, use (change:) with (text-style:) to apply those
		animations.

	/*d:
		(box: String, [Number]) -> Changer

		When attached to a hook, it becomes a "box", with a given width proportional to the containing element's width,
		an optional number of lines tall, and a scroll bar if its contained text is longer than its height can contain.

		Example usage:
		* `(box:"=XX=", 1)[Chapter complete]` produces a box that's centered, 50% of the containing element's width, and 1 line tall.
		* `(box:"==X", 3)[Chapter complete]` produces a box that's right-aligned, 33% of the containing element's width, 3 lines tall.
		* `(box:"X", 7)[Chapter complete]` produces a box that takes up the full containing element's width, and 7 lines tall.
		* `(enchant: ?passage, (box:"XXX="))` enchants the passage, placing it in the left of the window.

		Rationale:

		There are times when you want to make a block of text appear to occupy an enclosed, small region with its own scroll bar,
		so that players can scroll through it separate from the rest of the passage - for instance, if it's an excerpt of some
		in-story document, or if it's a "message log" which has lots of text appended to it with (append:). This macro
		provides that ability.

		Details:
		The first value you give to this macro is a "sizing line" similar to the aligner and column markup - a sequence of zero or
		more `=` signs, then a sequence of characters (preferably "X"), then zero or more `=` signs. Think of this string as a visual
		depiction of the box's horizontal proportions - the `=` signs are the space to the left and right, and the characters in
		the middle are the box itself. If you wish to specify that the box should take up the full width, you must provide
		just a single character, like "X" - anything more will cause an error.

		The second, optional value is a height, in text lines. This size varies based on the font size of the containing element,
		which is adjustible with (text-size:) and other changers. The hook will (as of version 3.3.6) be given a CSS `height` value of `1.5em`
		(the default CSS `line-height`) multiplied by the number of lines given. If you need to reposition the hook vertically, consider using
		(float-box:) instead. Note that this value will NOT adjust to match any custom CSS padding or line-height
		given to this hook in addition to (box:).
		
		If no height is given, then it will use a height large enough to display all of the lines, as usual.
		If a non-whole number is given, an error will be produced.

		The "containing element" is whatever structure contains the hook. If it's inside column markup, the containing column is the
		element. If it's inside another hook (including a hook that also has (box:) attached), that hook is the element. Usually,
		however, it will just be the passage itself.

		This changer does not interact well with (align:), which also sets the horizontal placement of hooks - adding these changers
		together will cause one to override the placement of the other. (align:) will also, if center-alignment is given, force
		the hook's horizontal size to 50% of the containing element.

		If you want the box's horizontal size to be a large proportion of the available width, it may be more readable if you uniformly varied
		the characters that comprise the sizing string: `(box:"=XxxxXxxxXxxxX=", 0.25)`, for instance, makes it easier to discern that
		the box is 13/15th of the available width.

		You can use this with (change:) or (enchant:) and `?passage` to affect the placement of the passage in the page. (Note that doing so will change
		the horizontal padding of the `<tw-story>` HTML element, which is normally 20%. It will become 0%, and the `<tw-passage>`'s new margins
		will define its position on the screen.)

		The resulting hook has the CSS attributes "display:block", "overflow-y:auto", and "box-sizing:content-box". Additionally,
		the hook will have 'padding:1em', unless another padding value has been applied to it (such as via (css:)).

	/*d:
		(float-box: String, String) -> Changer

		When attached to a hook, it becomes a "floating box", placed at a given portion of the window, sized proportionally to the
		window's dimensions, and with a scroll bar if its contained text is longer than its height can contain.

		Example usage:
		* `(float-box: "X====","Y====")[CASH: $35,101]` produces a box that's placed in the top-left corner of the window,
		is 20% of the window's width, and 20% of the window's height.
		* `(float-box: "=XXX=","======Y")[Marvin: "Really?"]` produces a box that's placed in the middle bottom of the window,
		is 60% of the window's width, and 1/7th of the window's height.

		Rationale:
		This is a variant of (box:). There are times when you want a single block of text to be separated from the main passage's text,
		to the point where it's positioned offset from it as a separate panel - character statistics readouts in RPGs, and commentary
		asides are two possible uses. Unlike (box:), which leaves the hook in the passage, this provides that necessary spatial separation.

		Details:
		The values you give to this macro are "sizing lines" identical to those accepted by (box:) - consult its documentation for more
		information about those lines. However, while those lines scaled the hook proportional to the "containing element", (float-box:)
		scales proportional to the reader's browser window, using `vw` and `wh` CSS units. The second string references the vertical
		position and size of the hook - since (box:) cannot affect the vertical position of the hook, it only accepts a number representing
		its size.

		It's a recommended convention that the centre characters in the sizing line strings be "X" (for "X axis") for the horizontal line
		and "Y" (for "Y axis") for the vertical - but you may use whatever you wish as long as it is not a `=`.

		Since it is "floating", this box remains fixed in the window even when the player scrolls up and down.

		The resulting hook has the CSS attributes "display:block", "position:fixed" and "overflow-y:auto". Additionally, the hook will have
		'padding:1em', unless another padding value has been applied to it (such as via (css:)).
