	/*d:
		(change: HookName or String, Changer or Lambda) -> Command

		Applies a changer (or a "via" lambda producing a changer) to every occurrence of a hook or string in a passage, once.

		Example usage:
		* `(change: "gold", (text-colour: yellow) + (text-style:'bold'))` makes all prior occurrences of "gold" in the text be bold and yellow.
		* `(change: ?passage's chars, via (text-color:(hsl: pos * 10, 1, 0.5)))` colours all of the characters in the passage in a
		rainbow pattern.

		Rationale:
		While changers allow you to style or transform certain hooks in a passage, it can be tedious and error-prone to attach them to every
		occurrence as you're writing your story, especially if the attached changers are complicated. You can
		simplify this by storing changers in short variables, and attaching just the variables, like so:
		```
		(set: _ghost to (text-style:'outline'))
		_ghost[Awoo]
		_ghost[Ooooh]
		```
		Nevertheless, this can prove undesirable: you may want to not use the _ghost styling later in development, which would
		force you to remove the attached variables to avoid producing an error; you may want to only style a single word or phrase,
		and find it inconvenient to place it in a hook; you may simply not like dedicating variables to storing changers, or in placing
		(set:) macros at the start of your passage's prose.

		Instead, you can give the hooks the name "ghost", and then (change:) them afterward like so:
		```
		|ghost>[Awoo]
		|ghost>[Ooooh]
		(change: ?ghost, (text-style:'outline'))
		```

		This has a few advantages. As it ties the changer styling to a hook name rather than a variable, the (change:) can be removed later without causing errors.
		Placing the (change:) at the end of the passage can also make the passage's source more readable, the textual content being closer to the top.

		Details:
		The (change:) macro can target plain text instead of hooks, much like (click:) - simply provide a string instead of a hook name.
		If a "via" lambda is supplied to (change:) instead of a changer, then that lambda is used to compute a changer dynamically, using the `pos` keyword
		to distinguish each hook that's enchanted. For instance, `(change: "O", via (text-style:(cond: pos is an even, 'bold', 'none')))` changes only
		even-numbered instances of the letter "O".

		Like the (replace:), (append:) and (prepend:) macros, this macro does not affect text and hooks that appear after it, as it is an immediate
		command that only affects what has already been rendered. For an alternative version of this macro which does affect hooks and text after it,
		see (enchant:).

		The built-in hook names, ?Page, ?Passage, ?Sidebar and ?Link, as well as their data names like `chars` or `lines`, can be targeted by this macro,
		and can be styled on a per-passage basis this way.

		Using (text-colour:) with this macro will let you change the colour of links inside the indicated hook, with one exception:
		using (change:) to change the entire passage (via `?passage` or `?page`) with (text-colour:) will NOT affect links. This is to allow you
		to re-style the entire story without having to lose the distinct colour of links compared to passage text. You can change the colour of all links using
		an explicit `(change: ?link, (text-colour: $color))` or by using `(link-style: (text-colour: $color))[=` (that is, with unclosed hook markup).

		You can't use this macro to change the appearance or behaviour of a completely empty hook, such as `|A>[]`. Completely empty hooks (that haven't had text inserted
		by (replace-with:) and the like) are always hidden by Harlowe.

		You can use (change:) with (transition:) to add transitions to hooks or text elsewhere in the same passage – however, if the (change:) macro is
		run after the passage was initially rendered, the transitions will begin animating in the middle of their usual animations, or, if enough time
		has passed, won't run at all. For example, `(event: when time > 2s)[(change:"Riddles", (t8n:"Shudder")+(t8n-time:3s))]` will
		apply a 3-second transition to each instance of the word "Riddles" in the passage, but since 2 seconds have already passed since those words were
		rendered, only the last 1 second of the transition will be visible.

		You cannot use (change:) with (link:), (replace:), or any of its relatives – because the enchanted hook or text is already in the passage, the link can't appear
		and it can't replace anything.

	/*d:
		(enchant: HookName or String, Changer or Lambda) -> Command

		Applies a changer (or a "via" lambda producing a changer) to every occurrence of a hook or string in a passage, and continues
		applying that changer to any further occurrences that are made to appear in the same passage later.

		Example usage:
		* `(enchant: "gold", (text-colour: yellow) + (text-style:'bold'))` makes all occurrences of "gold" in the text be bold and yellow.
		* `(enchant: ?passage's chars, via (t8n-delay:pos * 30) + (t8n:'instant'))` causes the passage's characters to "type out" when the
		player first visits, such as in a visual novel or other such computer game. Unlike (change:), this works well with instances of
		`(click:?page)[==` later in the passage.

		Rationale:
		This is a special version of (change:) which doesn't just perform a single transformation of a set of hooks or text - rather,
		like (click:), it creates an ongoing effect that constantly checks and reapplies the changers whenever new hooks or text are inserted into
		the passage, persisting until you navigate to another passage. Consider the following:
		```
		(enchant: ?ghost, (text-style:'outline'))
		|ghost>[Awooo]
		(link:">Wait.")[|ghost>[Oooowooo]]
		```
		If this were a (change:) command, the second hook revealed by the (link:) wouldn't be affected, as it is inserted into the passage after
		it's finished rendering. The (enchant:) macro allows you to guarantee that every hook or bit of text that you want the changer to affect
		is constantly affected.

		Details:
		The (enchant:) macro takes the same values as (change:) - a string can be given instead of a hook name, and a lambda can be given instead of
		a changer. See (change:)'s article for more details about these.

		This macro works well in "header" or "footer" tagged passages - using a lot of (enchant:) commands to style certain words or parts of
		every passage, you can essentially write a "styling language" for your story, where certain hook names "mean" certain colours or
		behaviour. (This is loosely comparable to using CSS to style HTML class names, but exclusively uses macros.)

		When targeting ?Page, ?Passage and ?Sidebar, there is generally no difference between using (enchant:) and using (change:), as there (usually)
		aren't any other hooks with those names in the passage.

		Like (change:), you cannot use (enchant:) with (link:), (replace:), or any of its relatives.

		The enchantment created by this macro cannot change the appearance or behaviour of a completely empty hook, such as `|A>[]`.
		However, once a hook stops being empty (such as when the (append:) macro appends to it), the
		enchantment created by this macro will automatically start applying to it.

		(enchant-in: HookName or String, Changer or Lambda) -> Changer

		A variation of (enchant:) and (change:), this applies a changer to every occurrence of a hook or string within just the attached hook, rather than the whole passage. As
		with (enchant:), the changer will be applied to every additional occurrence inserted into the attached hook.

		Example usage:
		```
		(enchant:?frog, (text-style:"italic"))
		"Opening remarks?"
		|frog>["Crok, crok, crok."]
		(enchant-in: ?frog, (text-colour:green))
		["Your response?"
		|frog>["Croak, croak."]
		"A stunning rebuke!"
		|frog>["Croooak."]]
		```

		Rationale:
		While (change:) and (enchant:) both allow hooks to have changers or styles applied to them, these macros produce commands that must be placed in the passage, and which
		affect every match within the passage. It can sometimes be convenient to restrict the effect of (enchant:) to just matches within a single area of prose, especially when matching
		using strings, the `?Link` hook name, or `?Page's chars`. Thus, you can use (enchant-in:), attaching it to a hook that encloses the area you want it to affect. The enchantment it
		produces will be treated as though it didn't exist outside of the attached hook.

		Details:
		You can use built-in hook data names such as `lines` and `chars` with this macro, such as by `(enchant-in: ?page's lines, $changer)`, which will style all of the lines in the attached
		hook with $changer. However, this construction appears counterintuitive when written out - the HookName selects all of the lines in the page, but only those within the attached hook are
		styled. So, more readable shorthand macros exist for both of these - (line-style:) and (char-style:) - which you ought to use instead.

		This macro takes the same values as (enchant:) and (change:), and will produce the same errors for the same values. So, (link:), (replace:), or any of its relatives cannot be given as the second
		value, and neither can a lambda that doesn't produce a changer.

		Note that this macro can only affect explicit hooks or string occurrences, and can't affect just "part" of a target. For instance, `(enchant-in: ?page, (background:red))[DANGER]` will NOT turn
		the background of the attached hook red, but `(enchant-in: ?page's lines, (background:red))[DANGER]` will (because the text "DANGER" is a line of text, and is thus targeted by `?page's lines`).

		This enchantment will be listed in the "Enchantments" tab of the Debug Mode panel when it's active, alongside enchantments created by (enchant:).

		Due to Harlowe engine limitations, this currently does NOT work when created by a lambda given to `(enchant:)` or `(change:)`, such as in `(enchant: ?passage, via (enchant-in:?frogs,(bg:(hsl:pos*30,0.5,1))))`.

		(link-style: Changer or Lambda) -> Changer

		When attached to a hook, this causes all of the links inside the hook to be styled using the specified changer. This is equivalent to using (enchant-in:) with `?link`.

		Example usage:
		* `(link-style:(b4r:"dotted"))[I stepped into the (link-reveal:"hall,")[ and the door shut behind me.]]` applies the changer produced by (b4r:) to the (link-reveal:) link.
		* `(link-style:via (text-colour:(cond: pos is an even, yellow, aqua)))[You choose: [[A]] [[B]] [[C]] [[D]] [[E]].]` gives the "A", "C" and "E" links an aqua colour, and the other links a yellow colour.

		Rationale:
		Links, being the primary interactive elements in your stories, need to be visually distinguished from the passage prose surrounding them. Harlowe applies a colour
		and boldness to links by default, but you'll often want to apply your own styles to links to suit your story. Rather than manually attach a changer holding those styles to
		every link where it appears, you can instead use this macro to style several links at once.

		If you wish to style every link in the passage or story equally, using (enchant:) with `?link` in a "header" or "footer" tagged passage is most effective. But, if you only wish to apply a
		style to links in certain sections of a passage, this macro is most effective.

		Details:
		As with (enchant-in:), this can be given a changer, or a lambda that produces a changer, which is run on each link individually, and can produce different changers for each, depending on
		their `pos` or a random macro. If the lambda doesn't produce a changer, an error will result.

		Also, as with (enchant-in:), (link:), (replace:), (append-with:), or any of its relatives cannot be given to this macro.

		This creates a hook-specific enchantment, similar to (enchant-in:), It will be listed under the "Enchantments" tab of the Debug Mode panel.

		This will also apply the style changer to (click:) links inside the hook.

		Due to Harlowe engine limitations, this currently does NOT work when created by a lambda given to `(enchant:)` or `(change:)`, such as in `(enchant: ?passage, via (link-style:(bg:(hsl:pos*30,0.5,1))))`.

		This gives every line in the attached hook a dotted border. Notice that blank "lines" aren't styled, and are ignored.
		```
		(line-style:(b4r:"dotted"))
		[Sometimes I think

		[Sometimes you feel like

		Rationale:
		This is a convenient and more readable shorthand for using (enchant-in:) with `?page's lines`. This lets you style all of the lines within a hook, as if they were in individual hooks themselves.
		This allows you to alter and adjust the amount of text inside the hook without having to manually wrap each line in a hook, or attach a changer, after each alteration.

		Details:
		A line is any run of non-whitespace text or code between line breaks (or the hook's start and end) - a word-wrapped paragraph of prose is considered a single "line" as a result.

		Rationale:
		This is a convenient and more readable shorthand for using (enchant-in:) with `?page's chars`. This lets you style all of the characters within a hook, as if they were in individual hooks themselves.
		A number of strange text effects are possible with this - each character can be rotated using (text-rotate-z:), each character can have a (hover-style:), each character can have a slightly different (text-size:),

				(replace: ...HookName or String) -> Changer
				
				Creates a command which you can attach to a hook, and replace target
				destinations with the hook's contents. The targets are either text strings within
				the current passage, or hook references.

				Not to be confused with (str-replaced:).

				Example usage:

				This example changes the words "categorical catastrophe" to "**dog**egorical **dog**astrophe"
				```
				A categorical catastrophe!
				(replace: "cat")[**dog**]
				```

				This example changes the `|face>` and `|heart>` hooks to read "smile":
				```
				A |heart>[song] in your heart, a |face>[song] on your face.
				(replace: ?face, ?heart)[smile]
				```

				Rationale:
				A common way to make your stories feel dynamic is to cause their text to modify itself
				before the player's eyes, in response to actions they perform. You can check for these actions
				using macros such as (link:), (click:) or (live:), and you can make these changes using macros
				such as (replace:).

				Using (replace:) is only one way of providing this dynamism, however - the (show:) macro also
				offers similar functionality. See that macro's article for an explanation of when you might prefer
				to use it over (replace:), and vice-versa.

				Details:
				(replace:) lets you specify a target, and a block of text to replace the target with. The attached hook
				(which specifies the replacement text) will not be rendered normally - thus, you can essentially put
				(replace:) commands anywhere in the passage text without interfering much with the passage's visible text.

				If the given target is a string, then every instance of the string in the current passage is replaced
				with a copy of the hook's contents. If the given target is a hook reference, then only named hooks
				with the same name as the reference will be replaced with the hook's contents. Use named hooks when
				you want only specific places in the passage text to change.

				If the target doesn't match any part of the passage, nothing will happen. This is to allow you to
				place (replace:) commands in `footer` tagged passages, if you want them to conditionally affect
				certain named hooks throughout the entire game, without them interfering with other passages.

				(replace:) (and its variations) cannot affects hooks or text that haven't been printed yet - if the (replace:)
				runs at the same time that the passage is appearing (as in, it isn't inside a hook that's delayed (live:), (link:), (show:)
				or similar macros), and a hook or line of text appears after it in the passage, the macro won't replace its contents
				even if it's a valid target. For example: `(replace: "cool")[hot] cool water` won't work because the (replace:) runs immediately,
				but `cool water (replace: "cool")[hot]` and `(event: when time > 5)[(replace: "cool")[hot]] cool water` will.

				As a result of the above, putting these in `header` tagged passages instead of `footer` tagged passages won't
				do much good, as they are printed before the rest of the passage.

				If you wish to use (replace:) to replace a hook with a copy of its own text, to undo the effects of other
				(replace:), (append:), (prepend:) or other macros on it, consider using the (rerun:) macro instead.

			/*d:
				(replace-with: String or CodeHook) -> Changer

				A counterpart to (append-with:) and (prepend-with:), this replaces the entirety of the attached hook with the contents of the given string (or code hook).

				Example usage:
				* `(set: $vitalInfoChanger to it + (replace-with:"**This sentence may contain mature content, so we've excised it from your mind.**"))` causes
				the changer in $vitalInfoChanger, which may have been used previously in the story, to replace the hooks' text with a censorship notification.
				* `(set: $locked to [(text-color:red)[Locked Content] - Beat the game to unlock])` creates a changer which replaces the attached hook with
				`[(text-color:red)[Locked Content] - Beat the game to unlock]`. This is mostly similar to passing the string `"(text-color:red)[Locked Content] - Beat the game to unlock"`,
				but the contents of the code hook are syntax-highlighted in the passage editor, making it easier to read. 

				Rationale:
				This changer macro may seem unintuitive and without obvious purpose - what is the point of a changer that changes a hook so drastically that
				nothing is left of its original text, and the player never sees it? However, there are some minor cases where such an effect is helpful: being able to
				pre-fill an empty hook with a given line of text not only saves you from having to write out that text multiple times (similar to saving that text
				in a variable by itself and using (print:) or a bare variable to display it), but also allows additional changers to be combined with it, and
				for (replace:), (append:) and (prepend:) macros to modify it afterward, by targeting the specific name of the attached hook. And, you can, at a
				later point in a story, add this to an existing changer to cause hooks it formerly changed to display different text content.

				Details:
				This changer, when attached to a hook, will never allow the prose it replaces to be run - `(replace-with:"")[(set:$x to 1)]` will not allow
				the enclosed (set:) macro to be run before it is replaced.

				This macro can't be used with (enchant:) or (change:) - attempting to do so will produce an error. You'll want to instead use (replace:), which
				accomplishes the same effect.

				* `(append: "Emily")[, my maid] ` adds ", my maid " to the end of every occurrence of "Emily".
				* `(append: ?dress)[ from happier days]` adds " from happier days" to the end of any hook tagged with `|dress>`.

				Rationale:
				As this is a variation of (replace:), the rationale for this macro can be found in

			/*d:
				(append-with: String or CodeHook) -> Changer

				Creates a changer that, when attached to a hook, adds the contents of the given string (or code hook) to the end of the hook.

				Example usage:
				* `(set: $cutie to (append-with:"~♡")+(color:red+white))` creates a changer that causes any attached hook to become pink and have `~♡` at the end.
				* `(set: $dateStamp to (append-with:[<br>Posted on: $date]))` creates a changer which appends `<br>Posted on: $date` to the end of the attached hook.
				This is mostly identical to providing the string `"<br>Posted on: $date"`, but the contents of the code hook are syntax-highlighted in the passage editor, making it easier to read.
				* `(set: $mattias to (prepend-with:'MATTIAS:"')+(append-with:'"'))` creates a changer that causes any attached hook to be surrounded with `MATTIAS:"`
				and `"`, which would be useful for character dialogue.

				Rationale:
				Some lines of prose you write in your story will tend to have identical endings, be they punctuation, dialogue tags, or otherwise,
				which you may tire of repetitively writing. This macro and (prepend-with:) allow you to automatically attach text without
				having to manually write it in full - simply save this changer to a variable, and attach it to the hook. While, it should
				be noted, you can use (append:) inside of a "footer" tagged passage to also automate this hook modification, this can, at
				times, be more convenient than having to modify a separate passage. Also, this macro is especially useful
				when combined with other changers, such as (text-style:), (font:) or (text-colour:).

				Details:
				The way this changer amends the text of the hook is similar to how (append:) amends hooks. To be precise, the full text of the hook is
				rendered before it is amended with these changers. This means that, among other things, code structures can't cross the boundary between
				the appended text and the hook - `(append-with:"</b>")[<b>Bold]` will NOT work as it seems - the `<b>` tag will not be matched with the `</b>`
				in the appended text.

				Multiple (append-with:) and (prepend-with:) changers can be added together. When this combined changer is attached to a hook,
				each constituent changer is applied in left-to-right order. So, `(append-with:" (5 Favs)")+(append-with:" (2 Reblogs)")[my teeth ate themselves]`
				will result in the hook reading `my teeth ate themselves (5 Favs) (2 Reblogs)`.

				This macro can't be used with (enchant:) or (change:) - attempting to do so will produce an error. You'll want to instead use (append:) or (prepend:),
				which accomplish the same effect of amending a hook or text occurrence remotely.

			"append",
			/*d:
				(prepend: ...HookName or String) -> Changer

				A variation of (replace:) which adds the attached hook's contents to
				the beginning of each target, rather than replacing it entirely.

				Example usage:

				* `(prepend: "Emily")[Miss ] ` adds "Miss " to the start of every occurrence of "Emily".
				* `(prepend: ?dress)[my wedding ]` adds "my wedding " to the start of any hook tagged with `|dress>`.

				Rationale:
				As this is a variation of (replace:), the rationale for this macro can be found in
				that macro's description. This provides the ability to prepend content to a target, adding
				preceding sentences or words to a text to change or reveal a deeper meaning.

				(prepend-with: String or CodeHook) -> Changer

				Creates a changer that, when attached to a hook, adds the contents of a given string (or code hook) to the start of the hook.

				Example usage:
				* `(set: $commandPrompt to (prepend-with:">")+(font:"Courier"))` creates a changer which makes the attached hook use a monospace font, with > placed at the start.
				* `(set: $dateStamp to (prepend-with:[**$location, $date.**<br>]))` creates a changer which prepends `**$location, $date.**<br>` to the start of the attached hook.
				This is mostly identical to providing the string `"**$location, $date.**<br>"`, but the contents of the code hook are syntax-highlighted in the passage editor, making it easier to read.

		"(click:"house")[...]", and every instance of "house" in the section becomes
		a link that does something.
		
		The enchantDesc object is a purely internal structure which describes the
		enchantment. It contains the following:
		
		* {[String]} event The DOM event (or events) that triggers the rendering of this macro's contents.
		* {String} classList The list of classes to 'enchant' the hook with, to denote that it
		is ready for the player to trigger an event on it.
		* {String} rerender Determines whether to clear the span before rendering into it ("replace"),
		append the rendering to its current contents ("append") or prepend it ("prepend").
		Only used for "combos", like (click-replace:)
		* {String} [goto] A passage to go to after rendering.
		* {Boolean} once Whether or not the enchanted DOM elements can trigger this macro
		multiple times.

			(click: HookName or String, [Changer or Lambda]) -> Changer

			Produces a changer which, when attached to a hook, hides it and enchants the specified target, such that
			it visually resembles a link, and that clicking it causes the attached hook to be revealed.

			Example usage:
			```
			There is a small dish of water. (click: "dish")[Your finger gets wet.]
			```

			Rationale:

			The (link:) macro and its variations lets you make passages more interactive, by adding links that display text when
			clicked. However, it can often greatly improve your passage code's readability to write a macro call that's separate
			from the text that it affects. You could want to write an entire paragraph, then write code that makes certain words
			into links, without interrupting the flow of the prose in the editor.

			The (click:) macro lets you separate text and code in this way. Place (click:) hooks at the end of your passages, and have
			them affect named hooks, or text strings, earlier in the passage.

			Details:

			Text or hooks targeted by a (click:) macro will be styled in a way that makes them indistinguishable from passage links,
			and links created by (link:). When any one of the targets is clicked, this styling will be removed and the hook attached to the
			(click:) will be displayed.

			Additionally, if a (click:) macro is removed from the passage, then its targets will lose the link styling and no longer be
			affected by the macro.

			You can add further styling to the "links" produced by (click:) by providing an optional changer or "via" lambda as a second value, similar to (link:)'s optional
			changer. If a "via" lambda is supplied, then that lambda is used to compute a changer dynamically, based on specifics of
			each hook that's enchanted, similar to lambdas provided to (enchant:).

			Targeting ?Page, ?Passage or ?Sidebar:

			When a (click:) command is targeting the ?Page, ?Passage or ?Sidebar, instead of transforming the entire passage text into
			a link, something else will occur: a blue link-coloured border will surround the area, and
			the mouse cursor (on desktop browsers) will resemble a hand no matter what it's hovering over.

			Clicking a link when a (click:) is targeting the ?Page or ?Passage will cause both the link and the (click:) to
			activate at once.

			Using multiple (click:) commands to target the ?Page or ?Passage will require multiple clicks from the
			player to activate all of them. They activate in the order they appear on the page - top to bottom.

			See also:
			(link:), (link-reveal:), (replace:), (click-replace:)

			Added in: 1.0.0
			#links 9
		*/
		/*d:
			(click-rerun: HookName or String, [Changer or Lambda]) -> Changer

			A special version of the (click:) macro which allows the enchanted hook or text (specified by the first value) to be activated multiple times to re-run the attached hook.

			Example usage:
			```
			The only place you haven't searched yet is the washing basket, and you know there's nothing to find in there.

			(set:_t to 0)\
			(click-rerun:"washing basket")[(set:_t to it+1)You pull out (nth:_t, "two left socks","a tie-dyed tie","a thimble","a laced tablecloth"). Just in case it was under there.]
			```

			Rationale:
			While the (click:) macro lets you add links to your text without placing lots of macro code in the middle of your prose, there isn't
			an obvious way of creating a repeatable link, similar to (link-rerun:) or using (link:) with (rerun:), in the same way. This macro provides that functionality.

			Details:
			This changes the enchanted text into a link in the same way as (click:). As with most link macros, you may style the link by providing a changer (or a lambda
			producing a changer) as the second value.
