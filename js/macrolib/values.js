		/*d:
			String data
			
			A string is just a run of text - a sequence of text characters strung together. To indicate that a
			sequence of characters is a string, place a matching pair of either `"` or `'` characters around them. If you want
			to include a `"` or `'` inside a string that is enclosed with a pair of that character, you can use the `\` symbol to
			escape that character. `\"` and `\"` will become a `"` and `'`, respectively.
			If you want to include a `\` character by itself, write `\\`.

			When the `\` character precedes the letters `n`, `t`, `b`, `f`, `v`, `r`, they will both be replaced with a certain whitespace character. Except for `\n`, these are
			**not** intended to be used by authors for any reason, are included purely for compatibility with Javascript, and are listed here for reference.

			| Combination | Result | Example
			| --- | --- | ---
			| `\n` | A newline (also known as a line break) |
			| `\t` | A tab character (normally only the same size as a single space) |
			| `\b`, `\f`, `\v`, `\r` | A zero-width character that takes up a position in the string but isn't visible in the passage (included for compatibility with Javascript) |
			| `\x` | If the next two characters are hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F, or a-f), all four of these are replaced with a character whose Unicode code point is the value of the digits. | `"\xFE"` (is `"Ã¾"`)
			| `\u` | If the next four characters are hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F, or a-f), OR if the next characters are `{`, one to five hexadecimal digits, and `}`, then all of these are replaced with a character whose Unicode code point is the value of the digits. | `"\u00FE"` (is `"Ã¾"`), `"\u{1F494}"` (is `"ðŸ’”"`)

			Note that you don't have to use `\n` to encode line breaks inside strings. You can simply insert them directly, thus causing the strings to span multiple lines.
			However, you may wish to use `\n` sometimes to save vertical space in your passage code.
			
			When making a story, you'll mostly work with strings that you intend to insert into
			the passage source. If a string contains markup, then the markup will be processed when it's
			inserted. For instance, `"The ''biiiiig'' bellyblob"` will print as "The <b>biiiiig</b> bellyblob".
			Even macro calls inside strings will be processed: printing `"The (print:2*3) bears"` will print "The 6 bears".
			If you wish to avoid this, you can include the verbatim markup inside the string:``"`It's (exactly: as planned)`"`` will
			print "It's (exactly: as planned)". Alternatively, you can use (verbatim-print:) to prevent the markup from being processed.
			
			You can add strings together to join them: `"The" + ' former ' + "Prime Minister's"`
			pushes the strings together, and evaluates to "The former Prime Minister's". Notice
			that spaces had to be added between the words in order to produce a properly spaced final string.
			Also, notice that you can only add strings together. You can't subtract them, much less multiply or divide them.
			
			Strings are similar to arrays, in that their individual characters can be accessed: `"ABC"'s 1st` evaluates to "A",
			`"Gosh"'s 2ndlast` evaluates to "s", and `"Exeunt"'s last` evaluates to "t". They, too, have a "length":
			`"Marathon"'s length` is 8. If you can't determine the exact position of a character, you can use an expression,
			in brackets, after it: `$string's ($pos - 3)`. You can create a substring by providing an array of positions
			in place of a single position: `"Dogs"'s (a: 2,4)` is "os". And, you can create a substring of consecutive positions by
			specifying just the start and end position as a data name: `"Ducks"'s 1stto3rd` is "Duc", and `"Rags"'s 2ndlasttolast` is "gs".

			If you want to check if a string contains any of another string's characters (without needing to be in the
			same order), or all of them, special `some` (also known as `any` - no relation to the `any` datatype) and `all` data names are available for use with the `is`, `is not`, `matches` and `is a`
			operators - `all of $name is "A"` checks if the variable consists only of capital "A"'s, and `some of $name is a whitespace` checks
			if any of the variable's characters is a whitespace character (using the special "whitespace" datatype).

			You can use the `contains` and `is in` operators to see if a certain string is contained within another: `"mother"
			contains "moth"` is true, as is `"a" is in "a"`. Again, `some` and `all` can be used with `contains` and `is in` to check all their
			characters - `all of $string is not "w"` is true if the string doesn't contain "w", and `$string contains some of "aeiou"` is true
			if the string contains those five letters. The opposite of the `is in` operator is `is not in` - `"w" is not in $string` is another way to phrase the above.

			If you want to check if a string specifically starts or ends with with a certain substring, `start` and `end` data names can be used in a
			similar way to `some` and `all` - `start of $addr is "http://"` is the same as `$addr's 1stto7th is "http://"` (but somewhat easier to write), and
			`end of $angelName is "iel"` is the same as `$angelName's 3rdlasttolast is "iel"`.

			Here is a table listing the aforementioned operations you can perform on strings, as well as a few others.

			| Operator | Function | Example
			| --- | --- | ---
			| `+` | Joining. | `"A" + "Z"` (is "AZ")
			| `-` | Produces a copy of the left string with all occurrences of the right string removed. | `"abcdcba" - "bcd"` (is "acba")
			| `is` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if both sides are equal, otherwise `false`. | `$name is "Frederika"`<br>`some of "Buxom" is "x"`
			| `is not` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if both sides are not equal, otherwise `false`. | `$friends is not $enemies`<br>`all of "Gadsby" is not "e"`
			| `contains` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the left side contains the right side, otherwise `false`. | `"Fear" contains "ear"`
			| `does not contain` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the left side does not contain the right side, otherwise `false`. | `"Fear" does not contain "Bee"`
			| `is in` | Checking if the right string contains the left string, otherwise `false`. | `"ugh" is in "Through"`
			| `is not in` | Evaluates to `true` if the right string does not contain the left string. | `"Blood" is not in "Stone`
			| `'s` | Obtains the character or substring at the right numeric position. `'s` cannot have any spaces to its left. | `"YO"'s 1st` (is "Y")<br>`"PS"'s (2)` (is "S")<br>`"ear"'s (a: 2,3)` (is "ar")
			| `of` | Obtains the character at the left numeric position. | `1st of "YO"` (is "Y")<br>`(2) of "PS"` (is "S")<br>`(a: 2,3) of "ear"` (is "ar")
			| `matches` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the left side describes the right side. | `str matches "Contract"`, `some of "RED" matches "E"`
			| `does not match` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the left side does not describe the right side. | `str does not match "Minotaur"`, `"3" does not match "Three"`
			| `is a`, `is an` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the right side is a datatype describing the left side. | `"Boo" is a string`, `"   " is a whitespace`, `"" is an empty`
			| `is not a`, `is not an` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the right side does not describe the left side. | `"Boo" is not an empty`, `"" is not a whitespace`
			
			And, here are the data names that can be used with strings.

			| Data name | Example | Meaning
			| --- | --- | ---
			| `1st`,`2nd`,`last`, etc. | `$str's last`, `1st of $str` | A single character at the given position in the string. This causes an error if it passes the bounds of the string, such as `"elder"'s 8th`.
			| `1stto3rd`, `4thlastto2ndlast` etc. | `"aeiou"'s 2ndto5th` | A substring containing only the characters between the given positions (such as the first, second and third for `1stto3rd`). This does NOT cause an error if it passes the bounds of the string - so `"Power"'s 3rdto9th` is `"wer"`.
			| `length` | `"Penny"'s length` | The length (number of characters) in the string.
			| `some`, `any`, `all` | `all of "aeiou" is not "y"`, `some of "aaaba" is not "a"` | Usable only with comparison operators, these allow all of the characters to be quickly compared. `any` is an old alias for `some` that functions identically, but which may be removed in a future version of Harlowe.
			| `start`, `end` | `start of $addr is "http://"`, `end of $angelName is "iel"` | Usable only with the `is`, `is not`, `matches` and `does not match` operators, these allow you to compare the start or end of strings without having to specify an exact range of characters to compare.
			| `random` | A random character in the string. | `"aeiou"'s random` (is `"a"`, `"e"`, `"i"`, `"o"` or `"u"`).
			| Arrays of numbers, such as `(a:3,5)` | `$str's (a:1,-1)` | A substring containing just the characters at the given positions in the string.

			A note about `random`: this is one of the features that uses Harlowe's pseudo-random number generator. If you use (seed:) at the start of the story,
			the selected values will be predetermined based on the seed string, and how many other random macros and features have been used before it.

		/*d:
			(str: ...[Number or String or Boolean or Array]) -> String
			Also known as: (string:), (text:)
			
			(str:) accepts any amount of values and tries to convert them all to a single String.
			
			Example usage:
			* `(print: "YOU NEED: $" + (str: $cash + 200))` converts the number `$cash + 200` into a string, so `"YOU NEED: $"` can be added to it.
			
			Rationale:
			Unlike in Twine 1 and SugarCube, Twine 2 will only convert numbers into strings, or strings
			into numbers, if you explictly ask it to. This extra carefulness decreases
			the likelihood of unusual bugs creeping into stories (such as adding 1 and "22"
			and getting "122"). The (str:) macro offers a quick way to convert
			non-string values to a string (and its counterpart, (num:), offers the reverse).
			
			Details:
			If you give an array to (str:), it will attempt to convert every element
			contained in the array to a string, and then join them up with commas. So,
			`(str: (a: 2, "Hot", 4, "U"))` will result in the string "2,Hot,4,U".
			If you'd rather this not occur, you can also pass the array's individual
			elements using the `...` operator - this will join them with nothing in between,
			as if they were given individually. So, `(str: ...(a: 2, "Hot", 4, "U"))` will result in the string "2Hot4U".

			If you want to convert numbers into strings in a more sophisticated way, such as by
			including thousands separators or leading zeros, consider using (digit-format:).

		/*d:
			(source: Any) -> String

			When given almost any data value, this will produce a string representation of Harlowe source code that can, when run, create
			that value exactly.

			Example usage:
			* `(source: $voltage)` will, if $voltage contains the number 9, produce the string `"9"`.
			* `(source: (str-repeated: 6, "HA"))` produces the string `'"HAHAHAHAHAHA"'` (which, you'll notice, is a string in a string).
			* `(source: (click: ?hat))` produces the string `"(click:?hat)"`.
			* `(source: (enchant: ?passage's hooks, $style))` will, if $style contained `(text-size:1.4)`, produce the
			string `"(enchant:?passage's hooks,(text-size:1.4))"`.

			Rationale:
			Throughout development, you'll often find yourself toying and tinkering with the exact values of data your story uses,
			such as to test a particular state of events, or to extract a particular procedurally-generated value. This macro, along
			with Harlowe's normal code parsing actions, provides a basic two-way conversion between code and data that you can use as you please.

			Details:
			For most complex values, like changers and commands, this will produce a macro call. The whitespace between the values will
			generally be absent, so `(source: (a:2,    3,   4))` produces `"(a:2,3,4)"`. Also, if you call a macro using one if its aliases,
			such as (array:) for (a:), then the source will still use its "default" name. So, `(source: (array:1))` produces `"(a:1)"`.

			Note that you can't easily print the string returned by (source:), because, funnily enough, Harlowe will immediately
			re-render it. You can use (verbatim-source:) to accomplish this instead.

			A special note about commands created by custom macros (via the (output:) macro): as of Harlowe 3.3.0, these *can* be given to this macro. However,
			the representation of this command will be a custom macro call, using the variable name that held the custom macro, *at the point the command was created*.
			What this means is that, for a custom macro stored in `$a`, the call `($a:2)` will produce a command whose (source:) representation is `"($a:2)""`. But, if
			the custom macro's variable is repurposed, such as by `(set: $a to 0)`, then the command will *still* be represented as `"($a:2)"`, even though $a no longer
			contains the custom macro which created the command. You can generally avoid this issue by keeping custom macros in the same variables for the full duration of
			the story.

		/*d:
			(substring: String, Number, Number) -> String
			
			This macro produces a substring of the given string, cut from two inclusive number positions.
			
			Example usage:
			`(substring: "growl", 3, 5)` is the same as `"growl"'s 3rdto5th` or `"growl"'s (a:3,4,5)`

			Rationale:
			You can obtain substrings of strings without this macro, by using the `'s` or `of` syntax along
			with either a specified range of consecutive positions, or an array of arbitrary position numbers.
			For instance, `$str's 4thto12th` obtains a substring of $str containing
			its 4th through 12th characters, `$a's (a:1,3,5)` obtains a substring of just the 1st, 3rd and 5th characters of $a,
			and `$a's (range:1, $b)` obtains a substring of each position up to $b.

			However, in the specific situation where you want to use a variable negative position, counting from the end of the string,
			there isn't a succinct option using that syntax. When gathering the characters in string $a
			between position 1 and $b, where $b is a negative position counting from the end, `(range:1, $b)` doesn't work, and
			the best you can do without this macro is something like `$a's (range: 1, $b + $a's length)`. So, this
			macro can be used as a slightly shorter alternative, by writing `(substring: $a, 1, -$b)`.
			
			Details:
			As mentioned above, if you provide negative numbers, they will be treated as being offset from the end
			of the string - `-2` will specify the `2ndlast` character, just as 2 will specify
			the `2nd` character.
			
			If the last number given is smaller than the first (for instance, in `(substring: "hewed", 4, 2)`)
			then the macro will still work - in that case returning "ewe" as if the numbers were in
			the correct order.

			Rationale:
			It can be useful to explicitly distinguish individual words within a string, in a manner not possible

			Details:

			This macro takes a whole number and a string, then converts the number to a string, joins them up with a space character, and pluralises the string if the

			English ordinals are useful to express that a number refers to a position or ordering of some object or item, but constructing an
			ordinal word from a number can be tricky, given that English ordinals have special cases for numbers ending in 1 or 2. This macro, then,
			serves to smooth over those cases, and provide a succinct means to construct these words.

			Details:
			Do not confuse this with the (nth:) macro, which is primarily used to display values in a sequence in passage prose.

			If the number isn't a whole number (such as 2.3), then an error will result.

			Note that you do NOT need to use this to access array data positions, even though their positions are written in the form
			`1st`, `2ndlast` and so forth. You can simply use numbers in brackets (such as `$inventoryArray's (2)`) to access a particular data value.

		/*d:
			(digit-format: String, Number) -> String
			
			When given a special formatting string, followed by a number, this macro converts the number into a string using
			the formatter as a guide. "#" characters in the formatting string represent optional digits; "0" characters
			represent required digits. Other characters are considered either thousands separators or as the decimal point.

			Examples:
			* `(digitformat: "###.###", -1234.5678)` produces the string `"-234.567"`.
			* `(digitformat: "###.###", -1/2)` produces the string `"-.5"`.
			* `(print: "$" + (digitformat: "##0.00", 0.96))` prints `$0.96`.
			* `(digitformat: "###,###", 155500)` produces the string `"155,500"`. Unlike every other character, commas are assumed to be thousands
			separators unless a different separator character is used before them.
			* `(digitformat: "### ###.", 500000)` produces the string `"500 000"`.
			* `(altered: via (digitformat: "000", it), ...(range:1,5))` produces `(a:"001","002","003","004","005")`.
			* `(digitformat: "###.###,", 1255.5)` produces the string `"1.255,"`. Note that the German decimal point `,` at the end
			of the string cannot appear in the final string, but serves only to distinguish the `.` as being the thousands separator.
			* `(digitformat: ".##,###", 1255.5)` produces the string `"55,3"`. Note that the German thousands separator at the front
			of the string cannot appear in the final string (because no `0` or `#` characters are before it),
			but serves only to distinguish the `,` as being the decimal point.
			* `(digitformat: "##,##,###", 2576881)` produces the string `"25,76,881"`. This uses Indian numeral separators.

			Rationale:
			The (str:) macro is a general-purpose conversion macro for creating strings out of other Harlowe datatypes. However,
			numbers have a number of different writing conventions depending on their context - in English, thousands separators
			are common for larger numbers, and some contexts, like prices, need trailing or leading zeros. Other languages
			have different separators than thousands separators, or use different decimal point characters. This macro lets you provide
			a specific format in which a number is to be converted to a string, allowing the separators, zeros
			and decimal point to be customised.

			Details:
			The decimal point in the format string is decided as follows: the rightmost character that isn't `#` or `0` is the decimal
			point, *unless* it is `,` and the leftmost character that isn't `#` or `0` is also `,`. This is under the assumption that
			most Harlowe users will be writing in English (the same assumption used for (str-nth:)) and thus formats like "###,###,###"
			intend to use `,` in its English sense as a thousands separator.

			If the decimal point has no digits (`#` or `0` characters) to its right, or the leftmost separator has no digits to its left,
			then they are left off altogether. This can be used to precisely specify the decimal point and separator characters without
			requiring them to appear in the final string: `"##.###,"` uses a trailing `,` to indicate that `,` is the decimal point, and
			`.` is the thousands separator.

			As a result of these two rules, it is *not* recommended that you include more formatting or context characters than what is required.
			For instance, a format string like `"$00.00"` will *not* cause the final string to have "$", because the `$` will be interpreted as
			a thousands separator, and thus removed.

			If a number bigger than 99999999999999999999 is given, this macro will produce an error.

			Errors in decimal representation caused by the underlying browser Javascript platform's floating-point number format,
			such as `(digitformat: "##.##", 35.3)` producing "35.29", are currently not compensated for by Harlowe.

			Number data
			
			Number data is just numbers, which you can perform basic mathematical calculations with.
			You'll generally use numbers to keep track of statistics for characters, count how many times
			an event has occurred, and numerous other uses.
			
			You can do all the basic mathematical operations you'd expect to numbers:
			`(1 + 2) / 0.25 + (3 + 2) * 0.2` evaluates to the number 13. The computer follows the normal order of
			operations in mathematics: first multiplying and dividing, then adding and subtracting. You can group
			subexpressions together and force them to be evaluated first with parentheses.
			
			If you're not familiar with some of those symbols, here's a review, along with various other operations you can perform.
			
			| Operator | Function | Example
			| --- | --- | ---
			| `+` | Addition. | `5 + 5` (is 10)
			| `-` | Subtraction.  Can also be used to negate a number. | `5 - -5` (is 10)
			| `*` | Multiplication. | `5 * 5` (is 25)
			| `/` | Division. | `5 / 5` (is 1)
			| `%` | Modulo (remainder of a division). | `5 % 26` (is 1)
			| `>` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the left side is greater than the right side, otherwise `false`. | `$money > 3.75`
			| `>=` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the left side is greater than or equal to the right side, otherwise `false`. | `$apples >= $carrots + 5`
			| `<` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the left side is less than the right side, otherwise `false`. | `$shoes < $people * 2`
			| `<=`~ | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the left side is less than or equal to the right side, otherwise `false`. | `65 <= $age`
			| `is` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if both sides are equal, otherwise `false`. | `$agendaPoints is 2`
			| `is not` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if both sides are not equal, otherwise `false`. | `$agendaPoints is not 0`
			| `matches` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if one side describes the other. | `$bytes matches 165`, `odd matches 3`
			| `does not match` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if one side does not describe the other. | `$coins does not match odd`
			| `is a`, `is an` | Evaluates to boolean  `true` if the right side is a datatype describing the left side | `$credits is a num`, `2 is an even`
			| `is not a`, `is not an` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the right side does not describe the left side. | `0 is not an odd`, `13 is not an even`

			`+` can also be used by itself to check if a variable is a number: `+$result` produces an error if $result is not a number.

			You can only perform these operations (apart from `is`) on two pieces of data if they're both numbers. Adding the
			string "5" to the number 2 would produce an error, and not the number 7 nor the string "52". You must
			convert one side or the other using the (num:) or (str:) macros.

			Finally, certain macros that accept numbers, such as `(live:)`, use those numbers as time durations. There is a special form of
			number data you can use for this â€“ put "s" or "ms" at the end of the number to specify if the number indicates milliseconds or
			seconds. For instance, `50ms` means 50 milliseconds, and `5s` means 5 seconds (which is 5000 milliseconds). A number suffixed with `s` is
			the same as a number suffixed with `ms` and multiplied by 1000.

			Rationale:
			Unlike in Twine 1 and SugarCube, Twine 2 will only convert numbers into strings, or strings

			carefulness decreases the likelihood of unusual bugs creeping into stories

			(datatype: Any) -> Datatype

			This macro takes any storeable value, and produces a datatype that matches it.

			Example usage:
			* `(if: _theirName is a (datatype:_myName))` checks whether or not $theirName is the same type as
			$myName.
			* `(altered: (datatype:_input)-type _n via _n + _input, ..._values)` creates a lambda that only accepts data with the same type

			Rationale:
			This isn't a macro you're likely to commonly use, because most of the time, you have exact knowledge of the
			types of data you use throughout your story. But, this can be helpful in custom macros created with (macro:), if they
			have any `any-type` parameters. Being able to identify the exact type that such a value is allows you to give types to other
			data based on that type.

			Details:
			The only types that this will return are "general" types, like `string`, `number`, `boolean` and such. More specific types
			like `even`, or descriptive types like `empty`, will not be returned, even if it's given a value that matches those types. Nor will
			spread datatypes be returned - even if a given string consists only of, say, digits, then `...digits` won't be returned instead of `str`.

			if there isn't a known datatype value for the given data (for instance, if you give it a HookName) then an error will be produced.

			This takes any storeable value, and produces a datatype that matches it, in a manner similar to (datatype:). However, when given an array or datamap,
			it creates an array or datamap with its values replaced with their datatypes, which can be used as a more accurate pattern with `matches` or (set:) elsewhere.

			Example usage:
			* `(datapattern: (a:15,45))` produces `(a:num,num)`.
			* `(datapattern: (passage: ))` produces `(dm:"name",str,"source",str,"tags",(a:str))` (as long as the passage has no metadata macros in it).
			* `$coordinate matches (datapattern: (a:15,45))` checks if $coordinate is an array of exactly two numbers. 
			* `(datapattern: $value) matches $value2` checks if $value2 exactly matches the structure of $value.

			Details:
			The (datatype:) macro is useful for examining and comparing the datatypes of values, but when dealing with arrays and datamaps, each of which can have radically
			different purposes and meanings throughout your story, that macro only produces `array` or `dm` when given them, which isn't too helpful when checking
			if one array is similar to another. This macro produces a more precise result - an array or datamap with datatypes replacing its values - which is compatible with
			the `matches` operator, the (set:) macro, parameters of the (macro:) macro, and other places where datatypes are useful.

			Details:
			This won't return structures containing spread datatypes, even if those could plausibly describe the passed-in data structure - an array with 26 numbers in it will,
			when given to this macro, produce an array containing `num` 26 times, no more or less.

			Note that this does not produce any string patterns, like those produced by (p:) - any string given to this will still result in `str` being returned.

			(a 40% transparent green).

			Rationale:

			The CIELAB colour model is considered to be more universally useful than the RGB model and its HSL representation,
			whose treatment of "lightness" doesn't properly reflect the actual perceived *luminosity* of the colours
			in question. For instance, this colour <tw-colour style="background:hsl(120,100%,50%);"></tw-colour>
			(produced by `(hsl:120,1,0.5)`) and this colour <tw-colour style="background:hsl(220,100%,50%);"></tw-colour>
			(produced by `(hsl:220,1,0.5)`) have the same HSL lightness (0.5), but one appears to the human eye to be less
			bright than the other, due to one hue being less luminous than the other.

			The lightness in LCH more closely corresponds to how the human eye perceives luminosity - `(lch:0.9,80,120)`
			produces <tw-colour style="background:rgb(177.74927536801104, 245.82494825009778, 78.56222683552888)"></tw-colour>, and `(lch:0.9,80,220)`
			produces <tw-colour style="background:rgb(171.75413233436592,237.65421375200268,254.99998540183145)"></tw-colour>, which, as you can see, is a pair closer in luminosity
			than the previous pair. Note that this means the lightness and hue values of LCH are **not** directly transferable between (hsl:)
			and this macro - they have different meanings in each. A hue angle in LCH is usually between 10 and 20 degrees less than its
			angle in HSL, varying by the LCH lightness.

			Additionally, CIELAB's colour model replaces the "saturation" value of HSL with "chroma". Rather than being a single percentage
			from 0 to 1, LCH's chroma is a value whose upper bound varies with the colour's hue, reflecting how the human eye distinguishes
			some hues more accurately than others.

			Details:
			Despite all of the above, any colour produced by this macro will have to be internally converted back to HSL in order to
			be used, due to HTML and CSS not fully supporting LCH as of 2020. As such, colours produced by this macro are constrained
			by HSL's limits - as LCH accepts a greater variety of chroma and lightness combinations than what HSL can represent, the output
			colour will be automatically converted to the nearest valid HSL values, if necessary.

			Giving lightness or alpha values less than 0 and greater than 1 will cause an error. Giving chroma values less than 0
			and greater than 132 will cause an error. However, you can give any kind of hue number to (lch:), and it will automatically
			round it to fit the 0-359 degree range - so, a value of 380 will become 20. This allows you to cycle through hues easily by
			providing a steadily increasing variable or a counter, such as `(lch: 0.9, 80, time / 100)`.

			whereas `red + blue` produces <tw-colour style="background-color:rgba(153,91,153,1);" data-raw=""></tw-colour>, a grayer fuchsia.
			* `(mix: 0.5, white, 0.5, #00f)` produces <tw-colour style="background-color:rgba(174.65024704481542,137.99348220075095,254,1);"></tw-colour>. The slight
			shift towards purple is a known weakness of the LCH colourspace.
			* `(mix: 0.4, red, 0.1, white)` produces <tw-colour style="background-color:rgba(243.25474741442827,92.29028459127169,68.073065830466,0.5);"></tw-colour>, a 50% transparent light red.
			Because the numbers only added up to 0.5, the result was 50% transparent (see below).

			Rationale:

			While you can mix colours in Harlowe using the + operator, such as by `red + yellow`, this operation doesn't easily
			allow for different mix ratios, such as a one-quarter/three-quarters mix, instead mixing both colours equally.
			In addition, in Harlowe 3, this uses the sRGB mixing method, which doesn't produce the most perceptually ideal colours, often making them
			darker or grayer than expected. This macro provides a more sophisticated alternative, allowing ratios for each colour to be specified, and using the LCH colour
			space to mix the colours, which tends to preserve chromaticity (colourfulness) better.

			Details:

			The colours are mixed in the LCH colourspace. What this means is: the colours are converted to their LCH datamaps (accessible as `$colour's lch`), and then
			(omitting a few minor details) their hue, lightness and chroma values are averaged. Then, the averaged values are used to construct a new colour, as if by the
			(lch:) macro.

			The two numbers (the ratios) are decimal values from 0 to 1. Numbers above or below will produce an error when given.

			If the two ratios do not add up to 1, then they will be scaled to compensate. For instance, for `(lch: 0.1, green, 0.3, blue)`, the 0.1 and 0.3 add up to 0.4,
			but they *should* add up to 1, so they are scaled up to 0.25 and 0.75, respectively.

			Additionally, if the two ratios add up to *less* than 1, then the difference will be converted into **additional transparency**, which is used to multiply
			the mixed colour's alpha. For instance, for `(lch: 0.15, red, 0.45, blue)`, the ratios 0.15 and 0.45 add up to only 0.6, which is 0.4 less than 1.
			So, the mixed colour's alpha (of 1) is multiplied by 0.6 (and thus made 40% more transparent than it would've been otherwise).

			(palette: String, Colour) -> Array

			When given a string specifying a palette type, and a colour, this macro produces an array containing the given colour
			followed by three additional colours that together form a palette, for use with (text-colour:), (bg:), and other macros.

			Example usage:
			```
			{(unpack: (palette: "mono", orange + black) into (a:_bg, _c, _lc, _hc))
			(enchant: ?page, (background: _bg) + (text-colour:_c))
			(enchant: ?link, (text-colour:_lc) + (hover-style: (text-colour:_hc)))}
			This passage uses (link:"(more)")[a brown palette.]
			```

			Rationale:
			Intended for game jams and rapid prototyping, (palette:) provides a quick and simple palette for stories and passages. When you aren't
			too fussed with making your story look significantly different from the Harlowe default, but just want a certain colour scheme to provide a certain
			mood, or colour a specific passage differently to offset it from the rest of the story, you can defer the task of choosing text or background
			colours to this macro. It will choose colours which contrast with the given colour to attempt to maximise readability, while still having an
			interesting relationship with the given colour's hue.

			Details:
			The following type strings are accepted.
			
			| String | Explanation
			| --- | ---
			| "mono" | The returned colours are tints and shades of the given colour.
			| "adjacent" | The returned colours' hues are 30Â° to the left, 30Â° to the right, and 60Â° to the right of the given colour's hue.
			| "triad" | The returned colours' hues are 140Â° to the left, 140Â° to the right, and 180Â° to the right of the given colour's hue.

			This macro interprets the passed-in colour as a background colour, and the three colours it provides are intended as text colours -
			but you can easily use them for other purposes. The given colour could be used as a text colour, and any of the received colours
			could be used as different backgrounds.

			The three returned colours all have a luminosity chosen to provide sufficient contrast with the given colour's luminosity. If
			the given colour's luminosity is very low or very high (near 0 or 1) then the returned colours will have a luminosity near
			the other extremity.

			(gradient: Number, ...Number, Colour) -> Gradient

			When given a degree angle, followed by any number of number-colour pairs called "colour stops", this macro produces
			a gradient that fades between those colours in the direction of the angle.

			Example usage:
			```
			(set: $desertChrome to (gradient: 0, 0, #e6a860, 0.49, black, 0.5, white, 1, blue))
			(background: $desertChrome)+(text-color:white)[Sunshine Desert]
			```
			The above example produces <span style="color:#fff;background-image: linear-gradient(0deg, rgb(230, 168, 96) 0%,
				rgb(0, 0, 0) 49%, rgb(255, 255, 255) 50%, rgb(25, 127, 230) 100%); display: initial;">Sunshine Desert</span>

			Rationale:
			An easy way to add a subtle sense of depth, texture, direction or variety to elements in Harlowe, without having
			to create and import background images from outside of Twine, is to use this macro to generate a gradient, a
			dynamically-generated background which can be used with (background:).

			A gradient consists of a series of flat colours. One of those colours will be used on one side of the element,
			one on the other, and the space in between will smoothly fade between them. You can supply additional colours
			that the gradient will smoothly fade to in between the start and end colours, too.

			To specify where exactly these intermediate colour fades will occur on the element, the colours are paired with
			a percentage number - 0 being one side of the element, 1 being the other, 0.5 being exactly in-between. This pairing
			is called a "colour stop".
			
			Consider this (gradient:) call, with six colour stops.
			`(gradient:90,  0,#bf3f3f,  0.2,#a5bf3f,  0.4,#3fbf72,  0.6,#3f72bf, 0.8,#a53fbf, 1,#bf3f3f)`

			The six colour stops are `0,#bf3f3f` <span style="width:1em;height:1em;display:inline-block;background:#bf3f3f"></span>,
			`0.2,#a5bf3f` <span style="width:1em;height:1em;display:inline-block;background:#a5bf3f"></span>,
			`0.4,#3fbf72` <span style="width:1em;height:1em;display:inline-block;background:#3fbf72"></span>,
			`0.6,#3f72bf` <span style="width:1em;height:1em;display:inline-block;background:#3f72bf"></span>,
			`0.8,#a53fbf` <span style="width:1em;height:1em;display:inline-block;background:#a53fbf"></span>,
			and `1,#bf3f3f` <span style="width:1em;height:1em;display:inline-block;background:#bf3f3f"></span>.
			This corresponds to the following gradient, which for documentation purposes has its colour stops marked.
			<div style="position:relative">
			<div style="position:absolute;left:0%;width:1px;background-color:black;color:white;height:64px;">0,<br>#bf3f3f</div>
			<div style="position:absolute;left:20%;width:1px;background-color:black;color:white;height:64px;">0.2,<br>#a5bf3f</div>
			<div style="position:absolute;left:40%;width:1px;background-color:black;color:white;height:64px;">0.4,<br>#3fbf72</div>
			<div style="position:absolute;left:60%;width:1px;background-color:black;color:white;height:64px;">0.6,<br>#3f72bf</div>
			<div style="position:absolute;left:80%;width:1px;background-color:black;color:white;height:64px;">0.8,<br>#a53fbf</div>
			<div style="position:absolute;left:100%;width:1px;background-color:black;height:64px;">1,<br>#bf3f3f</div>
			<div style="background:linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(191, 63, 63, 1) 0%, rgba(165, 191, 63, 1) 20%,
				rgba(63, 191, 114, 1) 40%, rgba(63, 114, 191, 1) 60%, rgba(165, 63, 191, 1) 80%,
				rgba(191, 63, 63, 1) 100%); height:64px;z-index:-1;"></div>
			</div>
			(gradient:)'s first argument is a degree angle, which can be used to rotate the gradient's direction, changing
			where the first and last colours are placed in the element. Changing the degree angle in the above example from 90 degrees
			to 0 changes it from a horizontal gradient to a vertical gradient, using the same colours and stops:
			<div style="background:linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(191, 63, 63, 1) 0%, rgba(165, 191, 63, 1) 20%,
				rgba(63, 191, 114, 1) 40%, rgba(63, 114, 191, 1) 60%, rgba(165, 63, 191, 1) 80%,
				rgba(191, 63, 63, 1) 100%); height:64px;"></div>
			
			Any angle can be given to (gradient:), including diagonal values like 40 or 66.

			Details:
			An error will be produced if you give colour-stop percentages that aren't between 0 and 1, or give less than 2 colour-stops. However,
			any number of degrees given to (gradient:), even below 0 or above 359, will automatically be rounded to fit the 0-359
			degree range - so, a value of 380 will become 20.

			You do not necessarily need to supply colour-stops at positions 0 and 1 - instead, the nearest colour-stop to those positions will be extended
			to the edge of the gradient. Furthermore, you don't need to supply colour-stops in ascending order - they will be reordered by Harlowe if they are not.

			Gradients in Harlowe are implemented using CSS `linear-gradient`s, and have the same limitations in output and browser support.
			Note, however, that the order of values for a colour stop is reversed from that of the CSS syntax (numbers go first, then colours).
			This is to help ensure that the initial degree number is not confused for a colour-stop percentage. Additionally, CSS
			linear-gradient "colour hints", which are used to adjust the midpoints between colour stops, are currently not supported by this macro.

			(stripes: Number, Number, Colour, Colour) -> Gradient

			When given a degree angle, a pixel distance, and two or more colours, this macro produces
			a gradient that draws a striped background, with each stripe as wide as the distance, and alternating through the given colours.

			Example usage:
			* `(enchant: ?page, (background: (stripes: 45, 20, fuchsia+white, white)))` causes the page to have a pink-and-white striped background.

			Rationale:
			The (gradient:) macro can be used to dynamically create gradient backgrounds, which smoothly transition between multiple colours. By using
			certain pairs of colour stops that are very close together, however, you can create gradients where the colours transition sharply, producing stripes.
			Rather than use that macro, you can instead use this one to generate striped backgrounds succinctly, that repeat uniformly, and with easily-adjusted
			stripe width.

			Details:
			The degree angle matches that given to (gradient:). A number of 0 causes the stripes to be drawn horizontally, and increasing that number rotates
			the stripes counter-clockwise. Any number below 0 or above 359 will automatically be rounded to fit the 0-359
			degree range - so, a value of 380 will become 20.

			The distance value given is in pixels, and determines the width of a single stripe.

			Gradients (including those produced by (stripes:)) in Harlowe are implemented using CSS `repeating-linear-gradient`s, and have the same limitations
			in output and browser support.

			(stripes:) gradients still have a "stops" array, accessible via `$stripeGradient's stops`, as with other gradients. Even though (stripes:) doesn't accept
			"colour stops", this array still contains colour stop datamaps, as if this gradient had been generated by (gradient:).
			There are two "stops" for each colour, and instead of a "percent" value, they have a "pixels" value. So, `$stripeGradient's stops's 1st's colour` will
			produce the colour of the first stripe, `$stripeGradient's stops's 3rd's colour` will produce the colour of the second stripe, and so forth.
			`$stripeGradient's stops's 2nd's pixels` will produce the pixel width of each stripe.

			Rationale:
			The standard syntax for referring to hooks, in macros such as (replace:), (change:) or (show:), is to write a HookName, such as `?door`. That syntax,

			This macro is called (hooks-named:) to avoid confusion with (hook:), and also to convey that a HookName will refer to any number of hooks as long as they
			have the same name.

			Details:
			Note that the HookNames produced by this macro have the same functionality as other HookNames. In particular, you can specify the `1st` hook, `2ndlast` and so forth
			by writing, for instance, `(hooks-named: "A")'s 2ndlast`. Also note that the built-in HookNames can be constructed with this macro - `(hooks-named:"passage")` is

			When given a sequence of booleans (the "conditions") paired with values, this provides the first value that was

			Example usage:

			conditionally run, there are plenty of situations where you'd prefer to succinctly select values inside macro
			calls, or select from multiple values, without needing to write multiple (else-if:)s or (set:)s for each possibility.
			The (cond:) macro (short for "condition") offers such utility.

			In situations where you would write something like this,
			
			```
			{(set:$lostTheSword to (either:true,false))
			(if: not $lostTheSword)[

			Boolean data
			
			Branching stories involve the player making choices, and the game using its own programmed logic to react to those choices.
			Much as how arithmetic involves manipulating numbers with addition, multiplication and such, logic involves manipulating the
			values `true` and `false` using its own operators. Those are not text strings - they are values as fundamental as
			the natural numbers. In computer science, they are both called *Booleans*, after the 19th century mathematician
			George Boole.
			
			`is` is a logical operator. Just as + adds the two numbers on each side of it, `is` compares two values on each
			side and evaluates to `true` or `false` depending on whether they're identical. It works equally well with strings,
			numbers, arrays, and anything else, but beware - the string `"2"` is not equal to the number 2.
			
			There are several other logical operators available.
			
			| Operator | Purpose | Example
			| --- | --- | ---
			| `is` | Evaluates to `true` if both sides are equal, otherwise `false`. | `$bullets is 5`
			| `is not` | Evaluates to `true` if both sides are not equal. | `$friends is not $enemies`
			| `contains` | Evaluates to `true` if the left side contains the right side. | `"Fear" contains "ear"`
			| `does not contain` | Evaluates to `true` if the left side does not contain the right side. | `"Fear" does not contain "eet"`

		/*d:
			(either: ...Any) -> Any
			
			Give this macro several values, separated by commas, and it will pick and return

			or "A slippery puddle".
			* `(go-to: (either: "Void 2", "Void 3", "Void 4"))` will send the player to one of three random passages.
			* `(text-colour:(either: red, yellow, green))` will create a (text-colour:) changer using one of the three colours.
			
			Rationale:
			There are plenty of occasions where you might want random elements in your story: a few random adjectives
			or flavour text lines to give repeated play-throughs variety, for instance, or a few random links for a "maze"
			area. For these cases, you'll probably want to simply select from a few possibilities. The (either:)
			macro provides this functionality.

			Details:
			This is one of the features that uses Harlowe's pseudo-random number generator. If you use (seed:) at the start of the story,
			the chosen value will be predetermined based on the seed string, and how many other random macros and features have been used before it.

			As with many macros, you can use the spread `...` operator to place all of the values in an array or dataset
			into (either:), and pick them randomly. `(either: ...$array)`, for instance, will choose one possibility from
			all of the array contents.

			If you want to pick two or more values randomly, you may want to use the (shuffled:) macro, and extract a subarray
			from its result.

			If you want to pick a value more reliably - for instance, to pick a value randomly, but keep using that same value
			in subsequent visits to the passage - you may want to store an (either:) result in a variable using (set:) in an earlier passage,
			and use that whenever you want to use the result.

		/*d:
			(nth: Number, ...Any) -> Any

			Given a positive whole number and a sequence of values, this selects the nth value in the sequence, where n is the number. If n is
			larger than the number of items in the sequence, the selection loops around to the start.

			Example usage:
			* `(nth: visit, "Hi!", "Hello again!", "Oh, it's you!", "Hey!")` will display a different salutation, in sequence,
			on the first, second, third and fourth visits, then return to "Hi!" on the fifth visit, and so on. This uses the "visits" identifier (also known as "visit").
			* `(nth: turn, "Full Moon", "Waning", "Halfmoon", "Crescent", "New Moon", "Crescent", "Halfmoon", "Waxing")` displays a different moon phase
			based on the current turn. This uses the "turns" identifier (also known as "turn"). This could be used in a "header" or "footer" tagged passage to display a moon phase in every passage.

			Rationale:
			This macro is designed to be used in passage prose, letting you quickly display one of a varying range of phrases or sentences based
			on a certain value. In addition to being useful with story variables, it's useful with the `visit` identifier, allowing you to
			vary the text shown on each subsequent visit to a passage, with more consistent variation than if you were using (either:).

			However, you can use (nth:) with any kind of value, not just strings. For instance, `(text-colour: (nth: $wounds, white, yellow, red))`
			will produce a (text-colour:) changer that differs in colour based on the number in $wounds (up to 3).

			Details:
			You can, of course, access a specific value in a sequence using the (a:) macro and the `'s` or `of` syntax - `(a: 1,2,3)'s ($n)`
			is functionally very similar to `(nth: $n, 1, 2, 3)`, and other uses of the (nth:) macro. (nth:), however, allows the given value to
			exceed the bounds of the sequence - `(nth: 4, 1, 2, 3)` would produce 1, whereas `(a: 1,2,3)'s 4th` would produce an error.

			If you wish to use (nth:) to display very large blocks of prose, you may wish to simply put that prose in hooks, and use (if:) to selectively display
			one, such as by writing `(if: visits is 3)`.

			If you don't want the "looping" to occur - if you want to only return the final value if the number exceeds the sequence - you can combine
			this macro with (min:). `(nth: (min: 3, visit), "", "", "")`

			You may be tempted to combine this macro with (shuffled:), as in `(nth: visit, ...(shuffled: "A", "B", "C"))` - however, this will NOT
			behave any differently from just using (either:) - each visit, the (shuffled:) macro will shuffle the sequence in a different way, so you
			can't guarantee that different values will be shown.

			(cond:), (if:), (either:)
