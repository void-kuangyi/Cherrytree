						it -> Any

						Like all identifiers, `it` is case-insensitive: `IT`, `iT` and `It` are all acceptable as well.

						This keyword is usually a shorthand for the most recently evaluated expression's leftmost value. It lets you write
						`(if: $candles < 2 and it > 5)` instead of `(if: $candles < 2 and $candles > 5)`, or `(set: $candles to it + 3)`
						instead of `(set: $candles to $candles + 3)`. (You can't, however, use it in a (put:) or (move:) macro:
						`(put:$red + $blue into it)` is invalid.)

						Since `it` uses the most recent expression's leftward value, `(print: $red > 2 and it < 4 and $blue > 2 and it < 4)` is the same as
						`(print: $red > 2 and $red < 4 and $blue > 2 and $blue < 4)`. This value of `it` changes to $blue in `it < 4` because
						the expression `$blue > 2` was evaluated by Harlowe just before, and $blue is the leftmost value inside that expression.
						(To get a greater sense of how Harlowe evaluates expressions, use Debug View in Harlowe's Debug Mode, then click on a 🔍
						button in the passage.)

						### Inferred `it`:

						In some situations, the `it` keyword will be *inserted automatically* by Harlowe when the story runs. If you write an
						incomplete comparison expression where the left-hand side is missing, like `(print: $red > 2 and < 4)`,
						then, when running, the `it` keyword will automatically be inserted into the absent spot - producing, in this case,
						`(print: $red > 2 and it < 4)`.

						### Inferred comparisons:

						In addition to the above, there are some situations involving chains of `and` and `or` operators where Harlowe can insert
						a missing `it` keyword *and the most recently-evaluated comparison operator*. If you write `(if: $a > 2 and 3)`, then Harlowe
						will decide, since it is incorrect to use `and` directly with numbers, that what you *actually* meant was `(if: $a > 2 and it > 3)`.

						### Special case - right-side inferred comparisons:

						Harlowe will make inferences even if the comparison is on the right side of the chain of `and` and `or` operators, such as `(if: 3 and 4 < $a)`.
						In these cases, however, Harlowe will slightly change the rules of the `it` keyword to conform to English grammar intuitions. `(if: 3 and 4 < $a)`
						intuitively means "if both 3 and 4 are less than $a" in English. So, it is interpreted by Harlowe as follows.
						Since `4 < $a` is the only complete expression, it is evaluated first. Then, the *rightmost* value, $a, becomes the `it` identifier's value.
						Then, `3` becomes `3 < it`. The macro call is now equivalent to `(if: 3 < $a and 4 < $a)`.

						Note that, since this special case **only** applies to `it` keywords that Harlowe inserts by itself, you shouldn't really worry about it when
						writing your stories. Just be aware of how right-side inferred comparisons work.

						### Special case - `it` in lambdas:

						There is another special case regarding the `it` identifier: inside `where`, `via` or `making` lambdas, `it` refers to the data value
						that the lambda is currently operating on, saving you from having to write it, or, in some cases, name it at all. A lambda like
						`_num where _num > 4` can be shortened to just `where it > 4` - the `it` identifier in this case replacing the `_num` temp variable entirely.

						### The `its` variant:

						If the `it` keyword equals a datamap, string, array, or other "collection" data type, then you can access data values
						using the `its` variant - `(print: $red is 'egg' and its length is 3)` or `(set:$red to its 1st)`. Much like the `'s`
						operator, you can use computed values with `its` - `(if: $red's length is 3 and its $position is $value)` will work as
						expected.

					/*d:
						time -> Number

						This keyword evaluates to the number of milliseconds passed since the passage
						was displayed. Its main purpose is to be used alongside changers
						such as (live:), (event:) or (link:). `(link:"Click")[(if: time > 5s)[...]]`, for instance,
						can be used to determine if 5 seconds have passed since this passage was displayed,
						and thus whether the player waited 5 seconds before clicking the link.

						It's recommended that you compare values of time using the `ms` or `s` suffixes for number data.
						See the article on number data for more information.

						When the passage is initially being rendered, `time` will be 0.

						`time` used in (display:) macros will still produce the time of the host passage, not the
						contained passage. So, you can't use it to determine how long the (display:)ed passage
						has been present in the host passage.

						As of Harlowe 3.3.4, when testing your story in Debug Mode, you can add a multiplier to `time` (so as to quickly advance
						the passage to an important part, or linger on an important part) by using the "Speed" dropdown in the Tools panel. If you change it to 0.5x,
						`time`'s number will be multiplied by 0.5, and so forth. Note that this option will currently not affect the speed of
						transitions (using (t8n-delay:) or (t8n-time:)).

					/*d:
						turns -> Number

						Also known as: turn

						This keyword (which can alternatively be written as "turn") evaluates to the number of turns that have occurred in this game. A "turn" is any movement to a
						passage, including movements back to the same passage, by passage links or by various (go-to:)-related macros.
						(redirect:) does not cause a new turn to occur, so using it will not increase this value.

						Much like the "visits" keyword, its main purpose is to be used with simple macros like (nth:) or (if:) to change what
						text is displayed, such as by `(if: turns > 7)`. It is also useful in (storylet:) lambdas, such as `(storylet: when turns > 7)`,
						for storylets that should only be available when a certain number of turns have elapsed.

						For testing purposes, it can be convenient to temporarily alter `turns`'s value, so as to recreate a
						certain game state. The (mock-turns:) macro, usable only in debug mode, lets you artificially increase the number
						that this evaluates to.

					},

					/*d:
						visits -> Number

						Also known as: visit

						This keyword (which can alternatively be written as "visit") always equals the number of times
						the current passage has been visited this game, including the current visit.

						Much like the "turns" keyword, its main purpose is to be used in (if:) macros, such as `(if: visits is 1)`,
						or `(if: visits > 4)`. If you use one particular formulation a lot in your story, such as `(if: visits is 1)`, you can (set:) the (if:)
						into a variable using `(set: $first to (if:visits is 1))` and then use $first in its place, such as in
						`$first[You've discovered a new island.]`.

						Similarly, it is also useful with the (cond:) and (nth:) macros - the latter letting you simply use `visit`
						as its first value to vary the results based on the number of times the passage is visited.

						This can also be used to great effect in (storylet:) macros, such as `(storylet: when visits is 0)`, where it will always refer to the containing
						passage itself. When Harlowe decides whether this passage is available to (open-storylets:), this will often be 0, but when
						actually visiting the passage, it will be at least 1.

						`visits` used in (display:) macros will still produce the number of times the *host* passage was visited,
						not the contained passage. So, you can't use it to determine how many times the (display:)ed passage
						has been (display:)ed.

						Using (redirect:) to go to a passage will count as a "visit" for that passage, even though it doesn't start a new turn.

						For testing purposes, it can be convenient to temporarily alter `visits`'s value, so as to recreate a
						certain game state. The (mock-visits:) macro, usable only in debug mode, lets you increase the number of
						times certain passages have been "visited", so that this keyword produces higher numbers when in those passages.

						By default, Harlowe records an unlimited amount of passage visits. However, you can use the (forget-visits:) macro to
						make Harlowe "forget" visits that are a certain number of turns old.

						Added in: 3.1.0

					/*d:
						exits -> Number

						Also known as: exit
						
						This keyword (which can alternatively be written as "exit") evaluates to the number of currently available "exits"
						in a passage - the number of link, mouseover, and mouseout elements that are active on the page, which could lead to new content and progress.

						This keyword is designed to be used with (live:) and (event:) - you can make a hook only
						be revealed when a certain number of exits are available, with `(event: when exits < 3)` and similar. The (more:) macro is a shorthand
						form for `(event: when exits is 0)`.

						The complete list of elements considered to be "exit" elements is as follows:
						* Links created by (link:), (link-repeat:), (link-reveal:), (link-goto:), (link-reveal-goto:), and (link-show:).
						* Passage links (which are the same as (link-goto:) links).
						* Links created by (click:), (click-replace:), (click-append:), (click-prepend:), and (click-goto:).
						* Mouseover areas created by (mouseover:), (mouseover-replace:), (mouseover-append:), (mouseover-prepend:), and (mouseover-goto:).
						* Mouseout areas created by (mouseout:), (mouseout-replace:), (mouseout-append:), (mouseout-prepend:), and (mouseout-goto:).

						Do note the following, however.
						* Multiple passage links that lead to the same passage (such as `[[A->Dead]] [[B->Dead]] [[C->Dead]]`) are all counted separately.
						* As of Harlowe 3.1.0, this does not consider (link-undo:) macros to be exits, as they tend to only undo game progress.
						* This will also not consider (event:) or (live:) macros to be exits, even if they are guaranteed to display their hooks
						eventually.
						* As with macros like (replace:), the `exits` keyword can't see forward to forthcoming elements, unless they've
						already appeared. For instance, the (print:) in `(print:exits is 1) [[Retreat->Hall]]` will show `false`, because the link after it
						hasn't appeared in the passage yet, but the (print:) in `(live:20s)[(print:exits is 1)] [[Retreat->Hall]]`
						will show `true`.
						* This can't be used in a (storylet:)'s lambda, because those lambdas are only checked when you're outside the passage.

						Finally, the "undo" and "redo" links in the sidebar will not be counted, either.

					/*d:
						pos -> Number

						Used exclusively in lambdas, this keyword evaluates to the position of the current data value that this lambda is processing.

						Consider a macro that uses lambdas, such as (altered:) - you give it a lambda, and then one or more data values, such as
						in `(altered: via it + (str:pos), "A","B","C")`. When the lambda is processing "A", the pos identifier is 1, for "B" it's 2, and for
						"C" it's 3. This can be used for a number of purposes. You can attach an ascending number to each data value, as in that example.
						You can make only odd-numbered values be altered by using `(cond: pos is an odd, it, it + (str:pos))` (which uses the "odd" datatype).
						You can make every third value be followed by a comma, by using `(cond: pos % 3 is 2, it, it + ',')`.

						Note that this only corresponds to the position of the values when given to the macro - if you use the `...` operator to spread arrays'
						values into a macro, such as `(find: where it is > pos, ...$array1, ...$array2, ...$array3)`, then values from $array2 and $array3 will not
						have a pos that corresponds to their placement inside those arrays, but rather relative to all of the values, including those in $array1.

						Make sure you do NOT write this as `its pos` - the pos is not a data value of the data itself! If `it` was `(dm:'HP',20,'XP',12)`, `its pos`
						would cause an error, as there is no "pos" value in that datamap.

						Using this anywhere other than a lambda, or using it in a 'when' lambda (which doesn't operate over a sequence of values), will cause an error.
