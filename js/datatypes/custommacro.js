		CustomMacro data

		These are custom macros produced by the (macro:) and (partial:) macros. You can (and should) store them in variables using (set:),
		and call them like any other macro, by using the variable instead of a name: `($someCustomMacro:)` is how you would
		call a custom macro stored in the variable $someCustomMacro, and `(_anotherCustomMacro:)` is how you would
		call a custom macro stored in the temp variable _anotherCustomMacro.

		Custom macros created with (macro:) have a single data name that you can examine.

		| Data name | Example | Meaning
		| --- | --- | ---
		| `params` | `$customMacro's params`, `params of $customMacro` | An array containing all of the TypedVar data given to the (macro:) macro when this was created.

		Placing custom macros directly into passage prose, such as by calling (macro:) outside of a (set:) or another data-storing
		macro, or writing a custom macro call incorrectly, will cause an error.

		For more information about custom macros, see the (macro:) macro's article.
