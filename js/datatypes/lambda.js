		Lambda data

		Suppose you want to do a complicated task with an array, like, say, convert all of its strings to lowercase,
		or check if its datamaps have "health" data equal to 0, or join all of its strings together
		into a single string. You want to be able to tell Harlowe to search for "each string where the string's 1st
		letter is A". You want to write a "function" for how the search is to be conducted.

		Lambdas are user-created functions that let you tell certain macros, like (find:), (altered:) and (folded:),
		precisely how to search, alter, or combine the data provided to them. Try thinking of them as stored expressions that
		operate on a single value in the sequence of data, which are then run on every value in turn.

		There are several types of lambdas, as well as lambdas that comprise multiple types.

		* **"where"** lambdas, used by the (find:) macro, are used to search for and filter data. The lambda `_item where _item's 1st is "A"`
		tells the macro to searches for items whose `1st` is the string "A".
		
		* For certain macros, like (for:), you may want to use a "where" lambda that doesn't filter out any of the values -
		`_item where true`, for instance, will include every item. There is a special, more readable **"each"** shorthand for this type
		of "where" lambda: writing just `each _item` is equivalent.

		* **"when"** lambdas are a variant of "where" used exclusively by (event:) and (storylet:), and are used to specify when a hook or passage should
		be shown. The lambda `when $fuel > 8` tells (event:) to show the attached hook when `$fuel` is increased (due to an interaction macro
		like (link-repeat:), a (live:) macro, or anything else). This really shouln't be called a "lambda", but you can perhaps think of it in
		terms of it filtering moments in time that pass or fail the condition.

		* **"via"** lambdas, used by the (altered:) and (sorted:) macro, are used to translate or change data. The lambda `_item via _item + "s"`
		tells the macro to add the string "s" to the end of each item. Only the (altered:) macro uses this to change values: the (sorted:)
		macro uses this to sort the data value as if it was another value.
		
		* **"making"** lambdas, used by the (folded:) are used to build or "make" a single data value by adding something from
		each item to it. The lambda `_item making _total via _total + (max: _item, 0)` tells the macro to add each item to
		the total, but only if the item is greater than 0. (Incidentally, you can also use "where" inside a "making" lambda -
		you could rewrite that lambda as `_item making _total via _total + _item where _item > 0`.)

		Lambdas use temp variables to hold the actual values. For instance, in `(find: _num where _num > 2, 5,6,0)`,
		the temp variable `_num` is used to mean each individual value given to the macro, in turn. It will be 5, 6 and 0, respectively.
		Importantly, this will *not* alter any existing temp variable called `_num` - the inside of a lambda can be thought
		of as a hook, so just as the inner `_x` in `(set: _x to 1) |a>[ (set:_x to 2) ]` is different from the outer `_x`, the `_num` in the
		lambda will not affect any other `_num`.

		If you want to be extra watchful for errors and mistyped data (and if you're working on a big project, you should!), you can include a datatype
		with each variable, such as by writing `str-type _a where _a contains 'e'` instead of `_a where _a contains 'e'`, to make it a TypedVar.
		You may notice that `_a contains 'e'` would also be true if `_a` was `(a:'e')` rather than, as intended, a string. Adding `str-type`
		allows such an error to be found and reported early, and results in a less confusing error message.

		You can use the "it" shorthand to save on having to write the temporary variable's name multiple times.
		`_num where _num > 2` can be rewritten as`_num where it > 2`. Not only that, but you can even save on naming the temporary
		variable at all, by just using `where` (or `via` or `making`) without the name and only using `it` to refer to the variable: `where it > 2`.

		Additionally, the "pos" identifier can be used inside a lambda - it evaluates to the position of the data value (from those passed into
		the macro) that the lambda is currently processing. `(altered: via it + (str:pos), "A", "B", "C", "A")` produces `(a:"A1","B2","C3","A4")`.

		An important feature is that you can save lambdas into variables, and reuse them in your story easily. You
		could, for instance, `(set: $statsReadout to (_stat making _readout via _readout + "|" + _stat's name + ":" + _stat's value))`,
		and then use $printStats with the (folded:) macro in different places, such as `(folded: $statsReadout, ...(dm-entries: $playerStats))`
		for displaying the player's stats, `(folded: $statsReadout, ...(dm-entries: $monsterStats))` for a monster's stats, etc.

		Lambdas are named after the lambda calculus, and the ["lambda"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function) keyword used in many popular programming languages.
		They may seem complicated, but as long as you think of them as just a special way of writing a repeating instruction,
		and understand how their macros work, you may find that they are very convenient.
