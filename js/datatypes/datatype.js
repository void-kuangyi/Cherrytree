		Datatype data

		Datatypes are special keyword values used to confirm that a variable's data is a certain type - for instance, that a variable that should only hold a number does indeed
		do so. They can be used to perform one-off checks using the `is a` and `matches` operators, and can be combined with variables to make TypedVars, variables that
		are restricted to a certain type and that automatically perform these checks for you.

		The built-in datatypes are as follows.

		| Value | Data type
		| --- | ---
		| `number`, `num` | Numbers
		| `string`, `str` | Strings
		| `boolean`, `bool` | Booleans
		| `array` | Arrays
		| `datamap`, `dm` | Datamaps
		| `dataset`, `ds` | Datasets
		| `command` | Commands
		| `changer` | Changers
		| `color`, `colour` | Colours
		| `gradient` | Gradients
		| `lambda` | Lambdas
		| `macro` | CustomMacros
		| `datatype` | Datatypes
		| `codehook` | CodeHooks

		In addition to the above, there are a few variations of these that only match a certain subset of each type.

		| Value | Data type
		| --- | ---
		| `even` | Only matches even numbers.
		| `odd` | Only matches odd numbers.
		| `integer`, `int` | Only matches whole numbers (numbers with no fractional component, and which are positive or negative).
		| `empty` | Only matches these empty structures: `""` (the empty string), `(a:)`, `(dm:)` and `(ds:)`.
		| `whitespace` | Only matches a single character of whitespace (spaces, newlines, and other kinds of space).
		| `lowercase` | Only matches a single lowercase character. Lowercase characters are characters that change when put through (uppercase:).
		| `uppercase` | Only matches a single uppercase character. Uppercase characters are characters that change when put through (lowercase:).
		| `anycase` | This matches any character which is case-sensitive - that is, where its (lowercase:) form doesn't match its (uppercase:) form.
		| `alphanumeric`, `alnum` | Only matches a single alphanumeric character (letters and numbers).
		| `digit` | Only matches a string consisting of exactly one of the characters '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', and '9'.
		| `linebreak`, `newline` | Only matches a line break character (also known as a "newline" character).
		| `const` | Matches nothing; Use this only with (set:) to make constants.
		| `any` | Matches anything; Use this with (macro:) to make variables that accept any storable type, or with (set:) inside data structure patterns.

		Finally, custom string datatypes can be created using a suite of macros, starting with (p:). If any of the string datatypes above aren't exactly suited to the task you
		need them to perform, consider using (p:) to create your own.

		If you want to check if a variable's data is a certain type, then you can use the `is a` operator to do the comparison. To check if the data in $money is a number, write `$money is a num`.

		Warning: you must write `is a` - don't write `$money is num`, because `is` by itself checks if the left side exactly equals the right side, and `num` represents all numbers,
		not the specific number contained in $money.

		Note that data that can't be stored in a variable, such as HookNames, doesn't have a corresponding datatype name, because you won't need to compare things to it.

		Additionally, along with the `is a` operator, there is a `matches` operator which is useful when you're dealing with data structures like arrays or datamaps. `$pos is a array` checks if $pos is an
		array, but that may not be precise enough for you. `$pos matches (a: number, number)` checks to see if $pos is an array containing only two numbers in a row. A data structure with datatype
		names in various positions inside it is called a **pattern**, and `matches` is used to compare data values and patterns.

		Spread datatypes:

		A modified datatype can be created using the `...` syntax inside an (a:) macro call or a pattern macro call. `...str`  can match any number of string values, including zero.
		You can think of this as a counterpart to the normal use of the spread `...` syntax - just as one array is turned into many values, so too is `...str` considered equivalent to enough `str` datatypes
		to match the values on the other side.

		Inside a typed variable in a custom macro call defined using (macro:)) a spread datatype refers to zero or more matching values being given at and after that variable's position in the macro call.
		The typed variable in `(macro: ...num-type _a, [(output:_a)])` refers to any number of numbers being given to the macro. The variable inside the code hook is an array containing all of those number values.
		See the (macro:) macro's article for more details.

		Inside a string pattern, like those created by (p:), spread datatypes have a slightly different meaning. They refer to zero or more sequences of the given datatype. `...whitespace` inside (p:) matches
		an entire string of whitespace, which can be one or more characters, as well as the empty string. `...digit` matches zero or more digit characters.

		Note: outside of macro calls and typed variables, spread datatypes are considered the same as normal datatypes. So, `(a:2,3) matches ...num` produces `false` - in this case, you should write `(a:2,3) matches (a:...num)` instead.

		Some more examples.

		* `(datamap:'a',2,'b',4) matches (datamap:'b',num,'a',num))` is true.
		* `(a: 2, 3, 4) matches (a: 2, int, int)` is true. (Patterns can have exact values in them, which must be equal in the matching data).
		* `(a: ...num, ...str) matches (a: 2, 3, 4, 'five')`
		* `(a: (a: 2), (a: 4)) matches (a: (a: num), (a: even))` is true.
		* `(p: (p-many:"A"), "!") matches "AAAAAAAA!"` is true.

		To summarise, the datatype operators are the following.

		| Operator | Purpose | Example
		| --- | --- | ---
		| `matches` | Evaluates to boolean `true` if the data on the left matches the pattern on the right. | `(a:2,3) matches (a: num, num)`
		| `is a`, `is an` | Similar to `matches`, but requires the right side to be just a type name. | `(a:2,3) is an array`, `4.1 is a number`
		| `-type` | Produces a TypedVar, if a variable follows it. Note that there can't be any space between `-` and `type`. | `num-type $funds`
		| `...` | Produces a spread datatype, which, when used in arrays or patterns, matches zero or more values that match the type. | `(a: ...str) matches (a:'Elf','Drow','Kithkin')`
