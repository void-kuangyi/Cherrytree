		CodeHook data

		Several macros, such as (dialog:) or (append-with:), are used to render some markup code stored in a string.
		However, markup code stored in strings can be difficult to write or read in the editor, because there's no syntax
		highlighting for the interior of string. It is also sometimes desirable to have markup code in strings appear
		different to other strings in Debug Mode, so that you can more easily tell what the string is used for in the game.

		Code hooks can be used as alternatives to strings in these cases. You may think of them as "hooks" that
		are written inside macro calls, as data provided to them. Place markup code between `[` and `]` symbols, in the
		same way that strings are between pairs of `"` or `'` symbols.

		Note that unlike strings, you can nest hooks inside code hooks without needing to escape the `]` symbol.
		`(print:[Good afternoon.(if:visits > 1)[ I'm glad to see you again]])` is a valid code hook.

		The (macro:) macro only accepts code hooks for the inner code of the custom macro. The contents of this hook will not be displayed when the
		custom macro runs, so you can put any number of comments and remarks inside it, for your own benefit.
