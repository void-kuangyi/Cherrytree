	/*d:
		Bind data

		A few macros that produce interactive elements, like (cycling-link:), have the ability to automatically update a variable whenever the
		player interacts with them. There needs to be a way to specify which variable these will update: simply giving the macro the variable
		itself, such as in `(cycling-link: $hat, "Poker visor", "Beret")`, won't work - the value that's currently inside `$hat` will be given
		instead, as one would expect for every other kind of macro. So, the `bind` keyword is needed to make your intent unambiguous:
		`bind $hat` produces a "bound variable".

		One can bind any kind of variable: story-wide variables like `$morality`, temp variables like `_glance`, and data values and positions
		inside them, like `$diary's 1st's event`. Once bound, the macro's element will set data to it automatically, as if by a series of
		unseen (set:)s or (move:)s.

		Two-way binds, created by the `2bind` syntax, enforce an equality that normal binds do not: whenever the variable changes outside
		of the element, such as by an `(event:)` macro, then the interaction element updates to match, if it can. Thus, there are two bindings
		between the data and the element using it: the variable updates when the element changes, and the element updates when the variable changes.

		Note that bound variables can't be (set:) into variables themselves, because there's no real point to doing so (and it could lead to
		a lot of undue confusion).

		| Operator | Purpose | Example
		| --- | --- | ---
		| `bind` | Binds the named variable on the right. | `bind $weapon`, `bind _hat`, `bind $profile's age`
		| `2bind` | Double-binds the named variable on the right. | `2bind $weapon`, `2bind _hat`, `2bind $profile's age`

		If you bind an array's `random` data name (a data name which normally provides a random value) then Harlowe will pick a random position,
		and retain that position for the duration of the bound variable's usage. So, if it picks the 3rd position, the macro using the bound
		variable will be consistently bound to the 3rd position's value.
