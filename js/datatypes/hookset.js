		A HookSet is an object representing a "hook selection". Hooks in
		Twine passages can have identical titles, and both can therefore be
		selected by the same hook reference. This class represents
		these selections within a given Section.

		In addition to regular hook selections, there is also "pseudo-hooks".
		A "pseudo-hook" is section text selected using a search string, rather
		than a hook tag reference. A macro instantiation like...
			(remove: "cats")
		...would make a pseudo-hook that matches, or "hooks", every instance of
		the string "cats" in the passage. So, without needing to mark up
		that text with hook syntax, the author can still manipulate it intuitively.
		This is a powerful construct!
	*/

	/*d:
		HookName data
		
		A hook name is like a variable name, but with `?` replacing the `$` sigil. When given to a macro that accepts it,
		it signifies that *all* hooks with the given name should be affected by the macro.
		For instance, `(click: ?red)` will cause *all* hooks with a `<red|` or `|red>` nametag to be subject to the (click:)
		macro's behaviour.

		In earlier Harlowe versions, it was possible to also use hook names with (set:), (put:) and (move:) to modify the
		text of the hooks, but macros such as (replace:) should be used to accomplish this instead.

		If a hook name does not apply to a single hook in the given passage (for instance, if you type `?rde` instead of
		`?red`) then no error will be produced. This is to allow macros such as (click:) to be placed in the `header` or `footer`
		passages, and thus easily affect hooks in every passage, even if individual passages lack the given hook name. Of course, it
		means that you'll have to be extra careful while typing the hook name, as misspellings will not be easily identified
		by Harlowe itself.

		If you wish to construct a hook name programmatically, based on an existing string variable, then the (hooks-named:) macro may be
		used in place of the above syntax.

		Built in hook names:

		There are five special built-in hook names, ?Page, ?Passage, ?Sidebar, ?Link and ?Visited, which, in addition to selecting named hooks,
		also affect parts of the page that you can't normally style with macros. They can be styled using the (enchant:) macro.

		* `?Page` selects the page element (to be precise, the `<tw-story>` element) and using it with the (background:) macro lets you
		change the background of the entire page.
		* `?Passage` affects just the element that contains the current passage's text (to be precise, the `<tw-passage>` element) and lets you,
		for instance, change the (text-colour:) or (font:) of all the text, or apply complex (css:) to it.
		* `?Sidebar` selects the passage's sidebar containing undo/redo icons (`<tw-sidebar>`). You can style it with styling macros, or use
		(replace:) or (append:) to insert your own text into it.
		* `?Link` selects all of the links (passage links, and those created by (link:) and other macros) in the passage.

		Data names:

		If you only want some of the hooks with the given name to be affected, you can treat the hook name as a sort of read-only
		array: specify just its `1st` element (such as by `?red's 1st`) to only affect the first such named hook in the passage, access
		the `last` to affect the last, and so forth. You can also specify multiple elements, using syntax like `1stto3rd`, to affect all of
		the elements between and including those positions. Even specifying an array of arbitrary positions, like `?red's (a:1,3,7)`, will work.
		Unlike arrays, though, you can't access their `length`, nor can you spread them with `...`.

		Moreover, a few special data names exist.
		* `chars` (as in `?title's chars`) selects each individual character inside the hook,
		as if it was in its own hook. This can be used for a variety of text effects - using (enchant:) with `?hook's chars's 1st` can be used to
		give a hook a styled "drop-cap" without having to explicitly style the leading character. This will NOT select whitespace characters.
		* `lines` (as in `?passage's lines`) selects individual lines of text within a hook. A line is any run of text or code between line breaks
		(or the passage's start and end) - a word-wrapped paragraph of prose is thus considered a single "line" as a result.
		* `links` (as in `?body's links`) is similar in use to `?link`, but only selects links within the hook.
		* `visited` (as in `?body's visited`) only selects links to visited passages. This allows you to affect and re-style these links
		in particular. These links normally have a different colour to normal links, but if you apply a colour to `?Link`, that colour is
		replaced. You can restore the distinct colour these links have by applying a colour to `visited` afterward.

		**Warning:** using `chars` with (enchant:) may cause text-to-speech assistive programs to fail to read the enchanted
		passage correctly. If this would be unacceptable for you or your story, refrain from using `chars` with (enchant:).

		**Warning:** using `chars` with (enchant:) to enchant very large amounts of text at once will likely cause excessive CPU load for the reader,
		making their browser unresponsive.

		| Data name | Example | Meaning
		| --- | --- | ---
		| `1st`,`2nd`,`last`, etc. | `?hook's last`, `1st of ?hook` | Only one hook with the given name, at a certain position in the passage relative to the rest (first with its name, last with its name, etc).
		| `1stto3rd`, `4thlastto2ndlast` etc. | `?hook's 2ndto5th` | Only hooks with this name, at a certain sequence of positions (such as the first, second and third for `1stto3rd`) relative to the rest.
		| `chars` | `?title's chars`, `chars of ?scream` | Each individual character within the hook, as if the characters were hooks in themselves.
		| `links` | `?body's links`, `links of ?aside` | Each link inside the hook.
		| `lines` | `?passage's lines`, `lines of ?passage` | Each span of continuous text, separated by line breaks, inside the passage.
		| `visited` | `?passage's visited`, `visited of ?passage` | Each passage link (and (link-goto:) link) inside the hook that points to an already visited passage.

		Operators:

		Unlike most forms of data, only one operator can be used with hook names.

		| Operator | Purpose | Example
		| --- | --- | ---
		| `+` | Creates a hook name that, when given to macros, causes both of the added hooks to be affected by that macro. | `(click: ?red + ?blue's 1st)` affects all hooks tagged `red`, as well as the first hook tagged `blue`.
